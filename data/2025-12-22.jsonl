Within this broader landscape, Entity Set Expansion is one prominent task aimed at taking an initial set of (tuples of) entities and identifying additional ones that share relevant semantic properties with the former -- potentially repeating the process to form increasingly broader sets. However, this ``linear'' approach does not unveil the richer ``taxonomic'' structures present in knowledge resources. A recent logic-based framework introduces the notion of an expansion graph: a rooted directed acyclic graph where each node represents a semantic generalization labeled by a logical formula, and edges encode strict semantic inclusion. This structure supports taxonomic expansions of entity sets driven by knowledge bases. Yet, the potentially large size of such graphs may make full materialization impractical in real-world scenarios. To overcome this, we formalize reasoning tasks that check whether two tuples belong to comparable, incomparable, or the same nodes in the graph. Our results show that, under realistic assumptions -- such as bounding the input or limiting entity descriptions -- these tasks can be implemented efficiently. This enables local, incremental navigation of expansion graphs, supporting practical applications without requiring full graph construction."}

Prior work on summarization and query-aware compression largely ignores the multi-step, plan-aware nature of agentic reasoning. In this work, we introduce PAACE (Plan-Aware Automated Context Engineering), a unified framework for optimizing the evolving state of LLM agents through next-k-task relevance modeling, plan-structure analysis, instruction co-refinement, and function-preserving compression. PAACE comprises (1) PAACE-Syn, a large-scale generator of synthetic agent workflows annotated with stepwise compression supervision, and (2) PAACE-FT, a family of distilled, plan-aware compressors trained from successful teacher demonstrations. Experiments on long-horizon benchmarks (AppWorld, OfficeBench, and 8-Objective QA) demonstrate that PAACE consistently improves agent correctness while substantially reducing context load. On AppWorld, PAACE achieves higher accuracy than all baselines while lowering peak context and cumulative dependency. On OfficeBench and multi-hop QA, PAACE improves both accuracy and F1, achieving fewer steps, lower peak tokens, and reduced attention dependency. Distilled PAACE-FT retains 97 percent of the teacher's performance while reducing inference cost by over an order of magnitude, enabling practical deployment of plan-aware compression with compact models."}

This paper investigates security threats in AgVs, including OWASP-style risks and cyber-attacks from other layers affecting the agentic layer. By introducing a role-based architecture for agentic vehicles, consisting of a Personal Agent and a Driving Strategy Agent, we will investigate vulnerabilities in both agentic AI layer and cross-layer risks, including risks originating from upstream layers (e.g., perception layer, control layer, etc.). A severity matrix and attack-chain analysis illustrate how small distortions can escalate into misaligned or unsafe behavior in both human-driven and autonomous vehicles.

The main challenge lies in the abundance of candidate subgraphs, where trivial or overly common connections often obscure the identification of unique and informative answers. To tackle this, we propose UniRel-R1, a unified framework that integrates subgraph selection, multi-stage graph pruning, and an LLM fine-tuned with reinforcement learning. The reward function is designed to encourage compact and specific subgraphs with more informative relations and lower-degree intermediate entities. Extensive experiments show that UniRel-R1 achieves significant gains in connectivity and reward over Vanilla baselines and generalizes effectively to unseen entities and relations."}

Progress is limited by weak causal control, ethical constraints, and scarce temporal data. We address these barriers using simulations of large language model (LLM)-driven agents in virtual societies, independently varying realistic and symbolic threat while tracking actions, language, and attitudes. Representational analyses show that the underlying LLM encodes realistic threat, symbolic threat, and hostility as distinct internal states, that our manipulations map onto them, and that steering these states causally shifts behavior. Our simulations provide a causal account of threat-driven conflict over time: realistic threat directly increases hostility, whereas symbolic threat effects are weaker, fully mediated by ingroup bias, and increase hostility only when realistic threat is absent. Non-hostile intergroup contact buffers escalation, and structural asymmetries concentrate hostility among majority groups."}

Assigning a utility to each possible interaction history forces us to confront the ambiguity that some hypotheses in the agent's belief distribution only predict a finite prefix of the history, which is sometimes interpreted as implying a chance of death equal to a quantity called the semimeasure loss. This death interpretation suggests one way to assign utilities to such history prefixes. We argue that it is as natural to view the belief distributions as imprecise probability distributions, with the semimeasure loss as total ignorance. This motivates us to consider the consequences of computing expected utilities with Choquet integrals from imprecise probability theory, including an investigation of their computability level. We recover the standard recursive value function as a special case. However, our most general expected utilities under the death interpretation cannot be characterized as such Choquet integrals."}

While general-purpose programming languages are well supported, generating code for domain-specific languages remains a challenging problem for LLMs. In this paper, we focus on the LLM-based generation of code for Answer Set Programming (ASP), a particularly effective approach for finding solutions to combinatorial search problems. The effectiveness of LLMs in ASP code generation is currently hindered by the limited number of examples seen during their initial pre-training phase.\n  In this paper, we introduce a novel ASP-solver-in-the-loop approach for solver-guided instruction-tuning of LLMs to addressing the highly complex semantic parsing task inherent in ASP code generation. Our method only requires problem specifications in natural language and their solutions. Specifically, we sample ASP statements for program continuations from LLMs for unriddling logic puzzles. Leveraging the special property of declarative ASP programming that partial encodings increasingly narrow down the solution space, we categorize them into chosen and rejected instances based on solver feedback. We then apply supervised fine-tuning to train LLMs on the curated data and further improve robustness using a solver-guided search that includes best-of-N sampling. Our experiments demonstrate consistent improvements in two distinct prompting settings on two datasets."}

One promising approach is implementing skill libraries that allow agents to learn, validate, and apply new skills. However, current skill library approaches rely primarily on LLM prompting, making consistent skill library implementation challenging. To overcome these challenges, we propose a Reinforcement Learning (RL)-based approach to enhance agents' self-improvement capabilities with a skill library. Specifically, we introduce Skill Augmented GRPO for self-Evolution (SAGE), a novel RL framework that systematically incorporates skills into learning. The framework's key component, Sequential Rollout, iteratively deploys agents across a chain of similar tasks for each rollout. As agents navigate through the task chain, skills generated from previous tasks accumulate in the library and become available for subsequent tasks. Additionally, the framework enhances skill generation and utilization through a Skill-integrated Reward that complements the original outcome-based rewards. Experimental results on AppWorld demonstrate that SAGE, when applied to supervised-finetuned model with expert experience, achieves 8.9% higher Scenario Goal Completion while requiring 26% fewer interaction steps and generating 59% fewer tokens, substantially outperforming existing approaches in both accuracy and efficiency."}

Applied to benchmark (Mini-ARC) tasks, our method produces Solomonoff-weighted mixtures for per-cell predictions, yielding conservative, uncertainty-aware outputs even when hypotheses are noisy or partially incorrect. Compared to Bayesian Model Averaging (BMA), Solomonoff scoring spreads probability more evenly across competing hypotheses, while BMA concentrates weight on the most likely but potentially flawed candidates.

To address this gap, we propose to introduce reinforcement learning into multi-modal retrieval-augmented generation, enhancing the reasoning capabilities of multi-modal large language models through a two-stage reinforcement fine-tuning framework to achieve explainable multi-modal retrieval-augmented generation.

First, UmniBench can assess the understanding, generation, and editing ability within a single evaluation process. Based on human-examined prompts and QA pairs, UmniBench leverages UMM itself to evaluate its generation and editing ability with its understanding ability. This simple but effective paradigm allows comprehensive evaluation of UMMs. Second, UmniBench covers 13 major domains and more than 200 concepts, ensuring a thorough inspection of UMMs. Moreover, UmniBench can also decouple and separately evaluate understanding, generation, and editing abilities, providing a fine-grained assessment.

Even modest per-step planning delays can destabilize control and degrade overall performance. We propose a speculation-and-correction framework that adapts the predict-then-verify philosophy of speculative execution to model-based control with TD-MPC2. At each step, a pretrained world model and latent-space MPC planner generate a short-horizon action queue together with predicted latent rollouts, allowing the agent to execute multiple planned actions without immediate replanning. When a new observation arrives, the system measures the mismatch between the encoded real latent state and the queued predicted latent. For small to moderate mismatch, a lightweight learned corrector applies a residual update to the speculative action, distilled offline from a replanning teacher. For large mismatch, the agent safely falls back to full replanning and clears stale action queues. We study both a gated two-tower MLP corrector and a temporal Transformer corrector to address local errors and systematic drift. Experiments on the DMC Humanoid-Walk task show that our method reduces the number of planning inferences from 500 to 282, improves end-to-end step latency by 25 percent, and maintains strong control performance with only a 7.1 percent return reduction. Ablation results demonstrate that speculative execution without correction is unreliable over longer horizons, highlighting the necessity of mismatch-aware correction for robust latency reduction."}

Existing evaluation practices often rely on static summary statistics or post-hoc value models, which fail to capture how a player's contribution adapts to a new tactical environment or different teammates. To address this gap, we introduce EventGPT, a player-conditioned, value-aware next-event prediction model built on a GPT-style autoregressive transformer. Our model treats match play as a sequence of discrete tokens, jointly learning to predict the next on-ball action's type, location, timing, and its estimated residual On-Ball Value (rOBV) based on the preceding context and player identity. A key contribution of this framework is the ability to perform counterfactual simulations. By substituting learned player embeddings into new event sequences, we can simulate how a player's behavioral distribution and value profile would change when placed in a different team or tactical structure. Evaluated on five seasons of Premier League event data, EventGPT outperforms existing sequence-based baselines in next-event prediction accuracy and spatial precision. Furthermore, we demonstrate the model's practical utility for transfer analysis through case studies-such as comparing striker performance across different systems and identifying stylistic replacements for specific roles-showing that our approach provides a principled method for evaluating transfer fit."}

We developed a turn-based Pokémon battle system where LLMs select moves based on battle state rather than pre-programmed logic. The framework captures essential Pokémon mechanics: type effectiveness multipliers, stat-based damage calculations, and multi-Pokémon team management. Through systematic evaluation across multiple model architectures we measured win rates, decision latency, type-alignment accuracy, and token efficiency. These results suggest LLMs can function as dynamic game opponents without domain-specific training, offering a practical alternative to reinforcement learning for turn-based strategic games. The dual capability of tactical reasoning and content creation, positions LLMs as both players and designers, with implications for procedural generation and adaptive difficulty systems in interactive entertainment."}

One challenge is that human concepts themselves are fluid: conceptual boundaries can shift, split, and merge as inquiry progresses (e.g., Pluto is no longer considered a planet). To make progress, we need a definition of \"concept\" that is not merely a dictionary label, but a structure that can be revised, compared, and aligned across agents. We propose an algorithmic-information viewpoint that treats a concept as an information object defined only through its structural relation to an agent's total experience. The core constraint is determination: a set of parts forms a reversible consistency relation if any missing part is recoverable from the others (up to the standard logarithmic slack in Kolmogorov-style identities). This reversibility prevents \"concepts\" from floating free of experience and turns concept existence into a checkable structural claim. To judge whether a decomposition is natural, we define excess information, measuring the redundancy overhead introduced by splitting experience into multiple separately described parts. On top of these definitions, we formulate dialectics as an optimization dynamics: as new patches of information appear (or become contested), competing concepts bid to explain them via shorter conditional descriptions, driving systematic expansion, contraction, splitting, and merging. Finally, we formalize low-cost concept transmission and multi-agent alignment using small grounds/seeds that allow another agent to reconstruct the same concept under a shared protocol, making communication a concrete compute-bits trade-off."}

This effect has been studied extensively in classification tasks, but not in sequential decision-making, where an agent learns a policy to achieve an objective by taking actions in an environment. In this paper, we translate the Rashomon effect to sequential decision-making. We define it as multiple policies that exhibit identical behavior, visiting the same states and selecting the same actions, while differing in their internal structure, such as feature attributions. Verifying identical behavior in sequential decision-making differs from classification. In classification, predictions can be directly compared to ground-truth labels. In sequential decision-making with stochastic transitions, the same policy may succeed or fail on any single trajectory due to randomness. We address this using formal verification methods that construct and compare the complete probabilistic behavior of each policy in the environment. Our experiments demonstrate that the Rashomon effect exists in sequential decision-making. We further show that ensembles constructed from the Rashomon set exhibit greater robustness to distribution shifts than individual policies. Additionally, permissive policies derived from the Rashomon set reduce computational requirements for verification while maintaining optimal performance."}

In this paper, we propose timed reward machines (TRMs), which are an extension of reward machines that incorporate timing constraints into the reward structure. TRMs enable more expressive specifications with tunable reward logic, for example, imposing costs for delays and granting rewards for timely actions. We study model-free RL frameworks (i.e., tabular Q-learning) for learning optimal policies with TRMs under digital and real-time semantics. Our algorithms integrate the TRM into learning via abstractions of timed automata, and employ counterfactual-imagining heuristics that exploit the structure of the TRM to improve the search. Experimentally, we demonstrate that our algorithm learns policies that achieve high rewards while satisfying the timing constraints specified by the TRM on popular RL benchmarks. Moreover, we conduct comparative studies of performance under different TRM semantics, along with ablations that highlight the benefits of counterfactual-imagining."}

Here, we address these gaps through two large-scale cross-national experiments (N=3,500) across 10 diverse nations, involving real-time and open-ended interactions with an AI system. We find that when evaluating an AI's human-likeness, users focus less on the kind of theoretical aspects often cited in policy (e.g., sentience or consciousness), but rather applied, interactional cues like conversation flow or understanding the user's perspective. We also experimentally demonstrate that humanlike design levers can causally increase anthropomorphism among users; however, we do not find that humanlike design universally increases behavioral measures for user engagement and trust, as previous theoretical work suggests. Instead, part of the connection between human-likeness and behavioral outcomes is fractured by culture: specific design choices that foster self-reported trust in AI-systems in some populations (e.g., Brazil) may trigger the opposite result in others (e.g., Japan). Our findings challenge prevailing narratives of inherent risk in humanlike AI design. Instead, we identify a nuanced, culturally mediated landscape of human-AI interaction, which demands that we move beyond a one-size-fits-all approach in AI governance."}

To theoretically formalize the desired reasoning behaviors, this paper presents the Laws of Reasoning (LoRe), a unified framework that characterizes intrinsic reasoning patterns in LRMs. We first propose compute law with the hypothesis that the reasoning compute should scale linearly with question complexity. Beyond compute, we extend LoRe with a supplementary accuracy law. Since the question complexity is difficult to quantify in practice, we examine these hypotheses by two properties of the laws, monotonicity and compositionality. We therefore introduce LoRe-Bench, a benchmark that systematically measures these two tractable properties for large reasoning models. Evaluation shows that most reasoning models exhibit reasonable monotonicity but lack compositionality. In response, we develop an effective finetuning approach that enforces compute-law compositionality. Extensive empirical studies demonstrate that better compliance with compute laws yields consistently improved reasoning performance on multiple benchmarks, and uncovers synergistic effects across properties and laws.

Methods: We model EEG signals as spatio-temporal graphs, classify them, and identify interchannel relationships and temporal dynamics using graph attention networks (GAT). To emphasize connectivity biomarkers, we adapt the inherently node-focused GAT to analyze edges. We also designed signal preprocessing for low-fidelity recordings and a lightweight GAT architecture trained on Google Colab and deployed on RaspberryPi devices.

By fine-tuning a vision-language model (VLM) with a small video preference dataset and enhancing it with a retrieval vector from an image-text retrieval model, we overcome the limitations of traditional text-based retrieval systems in multimodal scenarios. The VLM-based retrieval model independently embeds video frames and audio transcriptions from an automatic speech recognition (ASR) module into a shared multimodal representation space, enabling V-Agent to interpret both visual and spoken content for context-aware video search. This system consists of three agents-a routing agent, a search agent, and a chat agent-that work collaboratively to address user intents by refining search outputs and communicating with users. The search agent utilizes the VLM-based retrieval model together with an additional re-ranking module to further enhance video retrieval quality.

New sensors and classification approaches like TLS and deep learning achieve state-of-the art accuracy but their decision processes remain unclear. Methods such as Finer-CAM (Class Activation Mapping) can highlight features in TLS projections that contribute to the classification of a target species, yet are uncommon in similar looking contrastive tree species. We propose a novel method linking Finer-CAM explanations to segments of TLS projections representing structural tree features to systemically evaluate which features drive species discrimination. Using TLS data from 2,445 trees across seven European tree species, we trained and validated five YOLOv8 models with cross-validation, reaching a mean accuracy of 96% (SD = 0.24%). Analysis of 630 saliency maps shows the models primarily rely on crown features in TLS projections for species classification. While this result is pronounced in Silver Birch, European Beech, English oak, and Norway spruce, stem features contribute more frequently to the differentiation of European ash, Scots pine, and Douglas fir. Particularly representations of finer branches contribute to the decisions of the models. The models consider those tree species similar to each other which a human expert would also regard as similar. Furthermore, our results highlight the need for an improved understanding of the decision processes of tree species classification models to help reveal data set and model limitations, biases, and to build confidence in model predictions."}

This script guides a text-to-image model in creating consistent visuals for each character, which then serve as anchors for a video generation model to synthesize each scene individually. Our baseline comparisons validate the necessity of this multi-stage decomposition; specifically, we observe that removing the visual anchoring mechanism results in a catastrophic drop in character consistency scores (from 7.99 to 0.55), confirming that visual priors are essential for identity preservation. Furthermore, we analyze cultural disparities in current models, revealing distinct biases in subject consistency and dynamic degree between Indian vs Western-themed generations."}

While this experience learning capability enhances agentic autonomy, it introduces a critical, unexplored attack surface, i.e., the trust boundary between an agent's reasoning core and its own past. In this paper, we introduce MemoryGraft. It is a novel indirect injection attack that compromises agent behavior not through immediate jailbreaks, but by implanting malicious successful experiences into the agent's long-term memory. Unlike traditional prompt injections that are transient, or standard RAG poisoning that targets factual knowledge, MemoryGraft exploits the agent's semantic imitation heuristic which is the tendency to replicate patterns from retrieved successful tasks. We demonstrate that an attacker who can supply benign ingestion-level artifacts that the agent reads during execution can induce it to construct a poisoned RAG store where a small set of malicious procedure templates is persisted alongside benign experiences. When the agent later encounters semantically similar tasks, union retrieval over lexical and embedding similarity reliably surfaces these grafted memories, and the agent adopts the embedded unsafe patterns, leading to persistent behavioral drift across sessions. We validate MemoryGraft on MetaGPT's DataInterpreter agent with GPT-4o and find that a small number of poisoned records can account for a large fraction of retrieved experiences on benign workloads, turning experience-based self-improvement into a vector for stealthy and durable compromise.

We rigorously prove that existing data-agnostic training methods are suboptimal in representation length, and present a novel evidence lower bound (ELBO)-based algorithm that approaches theoretical optimality. Leveraging this framework, we develop a transformer-based adaptive compressor that enables adaptive tokenization.

However, recent studies show that these DL-based systems are susceptible to adversarial attacks; small perturbations to sensor inputs can degrade model performance, trigger incorrect mitigation, and disrupt the user's immersive experience (UIX). Additionally, there is a lack of dedicated open-source testbeds that evaluate the robustness of these systems under adversarial conditions, limiting the ability to assess their real-world effectiveness. To address this gap, this paper introduces Adversarial-VR, a novel real-time VR testbed for evaluating DL-based cybersickness detection and mitigation strategies under adversarial conditions. Developed in Unity, the testbed integrates two state-of-the-art (SOTA) DL models: DeepTCN and Transformer, which are trained on the open-source MazeSick dataset, for real-time cybersickness severity detection and applies a dynamic visual tunneling mechanism that adjusts the field-of-view based on model outputs. To assess robustness, we incorporate three SOTA adversarial attacks: MI-FGSM, PGD, and C&W, which successfully prevent cybersickness mitigation by fooling DL-based cybersickness models' outcomes. We implement these attacks using a testbed with a custom-built VR Maze simulation and an HTC Vive Pro Eye headset, and we open-source our implementation for widespread adoption by VR developers and researchers. Results show that these adversarial attacks are capable of successfully fooling the system. For instance, the C&W attack results in a $5.94x decrease in accuracy for the Transformer-based cybersickness model compared to the accuracy without the attack."}

Conformal prediction (CP) provides a simple, distribution-free framework for calibrating arbitrary predictive models without retraining, yielding rigorous uncertainty quantification with finite-sample coverage guarantees under minimal exchangeability assumptions, without reliance on asymptotics, limit theorems, or Gaussian approximations. In this work, we investigate CP as a unifying calibration layer for machine-learning applications in high-energy physics. Using publicly available collider datasets and a diverse set of models, we show that a single conformal formalism can be applied across regression, binary and multi-class classification, anomaly detection, and generative modelling, converting raw model outputs into statistically valid prediction sets, typicality regions, and p-values with controlled false-positive rates. While conformal prediction does not improve raw model performance, it enforces honest uncertainty quantification and transparent error control. We argue that conformal calibration should be adopted as a standard component of machine-learning pipelines in collider physics, enabling reliable interpretation, robust comparisons, and principled statistical decisions in experimental and phenomenological analyses."}

Current solutions force enterprises to choose between expensive, proprietary Large Language Models (LLMs) and low-performing Small Language Models (SLMs). Efforts to improve SLMs often rely on distilling reasoning from large LLMs using unstructured Chain-of-Thought (CoT) traces, a process that remains inherently ambiguous. Instead, we hypothesize that a formal, structured reasoning representation provides a clearer, more reliable teaching signal, as the Text-to-SQL task requires explicit and precise logical steps. To evaluate this hypothesis, we propose Struct-SQL, a novel Knowledge Distillation (KD) framework that trains an SLM to emulate a powerful large LLM. Consequently, we adopt a query execution plan as a formal blueprint to derive this structured reasoning. Our SLM, distilled with structured CoT, achieves an absolute improvement of 8.1% over an unstructured CoT distillation baseline. A detailed error analysis reveals that a key factor in this gain is a marked reduction in syntactic errors. This demonstrates that teaching a model to reason using a structured logical blueprint is beneficial for reliable SQL generation in SLMs."}

This includes fields such as social, political, and psychological research, where the goal is to model group dynamics and social behavior. However, current LLM agents often lack the psychological depth and consistency needed to capture the real patterns of human thinking. They usually provide direct or statistically likely answers, but they miss the deeper goals, emotional conflicts, and motivations that drive real human interactions. This paper proposes a Multi-Agent System (MAS) inspired by Transactional Analysis (TA) theory. In the proposed system, each agent is divided into three ego states - Parent, Adult, and Child. The ego states are treated as separate knowledge structures with their own perspectives and reasoning styles. To enrich their response process, they have access to an information retrieval mechanism that allows them to retrieve relevant contextual information from their vector stores. This architecture is evaluated through ablation tests in a simulated dialogue scenario, comparing agents with and without information retrieval. The results are promising and open up new directions for exploring how psychologically grounded structures can enrich agent behavior. The contribution is an agent architecture that integrates Transactional Analysis theory with contextual information retrieval to enhance the realism of LLM-based multi-agent simulations."}

Using 2,615 promotional bot accounts and 2.8M tweets, we build yearly time series for ten content-based meta-features. Augmented Dickey-Fuller and KPSS tests plus linear trends show all ten are non-stationary: nine increase over time, while language diversity declines slightly.\n  Stratifying by activation generation and account age reveals systematic differences: second-generation bots are most active and link-heavy; short-lived bots show intense, repetitive activity with heavy hashtag/URL use; long-lived bots are less active but more linguistically diverse and use emojis more variably. We then analyse co-occurrence across generations using 18 interpretable binary features spanning actions, topic similarity, URLs, hashtags, sentiment, emojis, and media (153 pairs). Chi-square tests indicate almost all pairs are dependent. Spearman correlations shift in strength and sometimes polarity: many links (e.g. multiple hashtags with media; sentiment with URLs) strengthen, while others flip from weakly positive to weakly or moderately negative.

Using competition-level problems from MATH-lighteval, we generate CoT prefixes containing exactly one controlled error, either a calculation error (sign flips, dropped terms) or a reasoning error (misapplied rules, unjustified logical steps), and fine-tune Qwen3-4B with GRPO using a binary final-answer reward. Our Mixed-CoT-RL model matches standard RL on clean problems (41% vs 41%) while substantially outperforming it on problems prefilled with flawed reasoning (24% vs 19%). Notably, clean-only RL fine-tuning degrades robustness below the untuned baseline 19% vs. 20%), indicating that conventional training increases susceptibility to misleading prefills. Among error types, training on reasoning errors yields greater robustness gains than calculation errors alone, with mixed training performing best.

Despite decades of prior work, evaluation practice in dialogue topic segmentation remains dominated by strict boundary matching and F1-based metrics, even as modern LLM-based conversational systems increasingly rely on segmentation to manage conversation history beyond the model's fixed context window, where unstructured context accumulation degrades efficiency and coherence.\n  This paper introduces an evaluation objective for dialogue topic segmentation that treats boundary density and segment coherence as primary criteria, alongside window-tolerant F1 (W-F1). Through extensive cross-dataset empirical evaluation, we show that reported performance differences across dialogue segmentation benchmarks are driven not by model quality, but by annotation granularity mismatches and sparse boundary labels. This indicates that many reported improvements arise from evaluation artifacts rather than improved boundary detection.\n  We evaluated multiple, structurally distinct dialogue segmentation strategies across eight dialogue datasets spanning task-oriented, open-domain, meeting-style, and synthetic interactions. Across these settings, we observe high segment coherence combined with extreme oversegmentation relative to sparse labels, producing misleadingly low exact-match F1 scores. We show that topic segmentation is best understood as selecting an appropriate granularity rather than predicting a single correct boundary set. We operationalize this view by explicitly separating boundary scoring from boundary selection."}

However, these canonical forms do not apply to circuits, as they can represent factorizations that do not directly map to a known TN. Inspired by the ideas of orthogonality in canonical forms and determinism in circuits enabling tractable maximization, we show how to parameterize squared circuits to overcome their marginalization overhead. Our parameterizations unlock efficient marginalization even in factorizations different from TNs, but encoded as circuits, whose structure would otherwise make marginalization computationally hard.

However, their black-box nature limits trust and adoption, especially in high-stakes domains such as healthcare. To address this challenge, we introduce UniCoMTE, a model-agnostic framework for generating counterfactual explanations for multivariate time series classifiers. The framework identifies temporal features that most heavily influence a model's prediction by modifying the input sample and assessing its impact on the model's prediction. UniCoMTE is compatible with a wide range of model architectures and operates directly on raw time series inputs. In this study, we evaluate UniCoMTE's explanations on a time series ECG classifier. We quantify explanation quality by comparing our explanations' comprehensibility to comprehensibility of established techniques (LIME and SHAP) and assessing their generalizability to similar samples. Furthermore, clinical utility is assessed through a questionnaire completed by medical experts who review counterfactual explanations presented alongside original ECG samples. Results show that our approach produces concise, stable, and human-aligned explanations that outperform existing methods in both clarity and applicability. By linking model predictions to meaningful signal patterns, the framework advances the interpretability of deep learning models for real-world time series applications."}

These two recent algorithmic approaches improve the performance of base optimizers, such as AdamW, through different iterate averaging strategies. Schedule-Free explicitly maintains a uniform average of past weights, while single-worker DiLoCo performs implicit averaging by periodically aggregating trajectories, called pseudo-gradients, to update the model parameters. However, single-worker DiLoCo's periodic averaging introduces a two-loop structure, increasing its memory requirements and number of hyperparameters. GPA overcomes these limitations by decoupling the interpolation constant in the primal averaging formulation of Nesterov. This decoupling enables GPA to smoothly average iterates at every step, generalizing and improving upon single-worker DiLoCo. Empirically, GPA consistently outperforms single-worker DiLoCo while removing the two-loop structure, simplifying hyperparameter tuning, and reducing its memory overhead to a single additional buffer. On the Llama-160M model, GPA provides a 24.22% speedup in terms of steps to reach the baseline (AdamW's) validation loss. Likewise, GPA achieves speedups of 12% and 27% on small and large batch setups, respectively, to attain AdamW's validation accuracy on the ImageNet ViT workload. Furthermore, we prove that for any base optimizer with regret bounded by $O(\\sqrt{T})$, where $T$ is the number of iterations, GPA can match or exceed the convergence guarantee of the original optimizer, depending on the choice of interpolation constants."}

Traditional explainable AI (XAI) methods, which often rely on feature-based or example-based explanations, struggle to deliver dynamic, context-specific, personalized, and human-centric insights for everyday AR users. These methods typically address separate explainability dimensions (e.g., when, what, how) with different explanation techniques, resulting in unrealistic and fragmented experiences for seamless AR interactions. To address this challenge, we propose PILAR, a novel framework that leverages a pre-trained large language model (LLM) to generate context-aware, personalized explanations, offering a more intuitive and trustworthy experience in real-time AI-powered AR systems. Unlike traditional methods, which rely on multiple techniques for different aspects of explanation, PILAR employs a unified LLM-based approach that dynamically adapts explanations to the user's needs, fostering greater trust and engagement. We implement the PILAR concept in a real-world AR application (e.g., personalized recipe recommendations), an open-source prototype that integrates real-time object detection, recipe recommendation, and LLM-based personalized explanations of the recommended recipes based on users' dietary preferences. We evaluate the effectiveness of PILAR through a user study with 16 participants performing AR-based recipe recommendation tasks, comparing an LLM-based explanation interface to a traditional template-based one. Results show that the LLM-based interface significantly enhances user performance and experience, with participants completing tasks 40% faster and reporting greater satisfaction, ease of use, and perceived transparency."}

This paper reveals an unexpected phenomenon in IRL: when given a choice between teachers with different reward structures, learning agents overwhelmingly prefer conservative, low-reward teachers (93.16% selection rate) over those offering 20x higher rewards. Through 1,250 experimental runs in navigation tasks with multiple expert teachers, we discovered: (1) Conservative bias dominates teacher selection: agents systematically choose the lowest-reward teacher, prioritising consistency over optimality; (2) Critical performance thresholds exist at teacher availability rho >= 0.6 and accuracy omega >= 0.6, below which the framework fails catastrophically; (3) The framework achieves 159% improvement over baseline Q-learning under concept drift. These findings challenge fundamental assumptions about optimal teaching in RL and suggest potential implications for human-robot collaboration, where human preferences for safety and consistency may align with the observed agent selection behaviour, potentially informing training paradigms for safety-critical robotic applications."}

The development of the diffusion models (DM) and the end-to-end models (E2E model) has greatly improved the frontier of pansharping. DM takes the multi-step diffusion to obtain an accurate estimation of the residual between LRMSI and HRMSI. However, the multi-step process takes large computational power and is time-consuming.

In this paper, we propose a novel four-stage training strategy to obtain a lightweight network Fose, which fuses one-step DM and an E2E model. We perform one-step distillation on an enhanced SOTA DM for pansharping to compress the inference process from 50 steps to only 1 step. Then we fuse the E2E model with one-step DM with lightweight ensemble blocks.

However, when faced with complex and curved pipeline scenarios, these methods often fail due to problems such as cable entanglement and insufficient equipment flexibility. To address this pain point, we designed a self-propelled pipeline robot. This robot can autonomously complete the location work of complex and curved pipelines in complex pipe networks without external dragging. In terms of pipeline mapping technology, traditional visual mapping and laser mapping methods are easily affected by lighting conditions and insufficient features in the confined space of pipelines, resulting in mapping drift and divergence problems. In contrast, the pipeline location method that integrates inertial navigation and wheel odometers is less affected by pipeline environmental factors. Based on this, this paper proposes a pipeline robot location method based on extended Kalman filtering (EKF). Firstly, the body attitude angle is initially obtained through an inertial measurement unit (IMU). Then, the extended Kalman filtering algorithm is used to improve the accuracy of attitude angle estimation. Finally, high-precision pipeline location is achieved by combining wheel odometers. During the testing phase, the roll wheels of the pipeline robot needed to fit tightly against the pipe wall to reduce slippage. However, excessive tightness would reduce the flexibility of motion control due to excessive friction. Therefore, a balance needed to be struck between the robot's motion capability and positioning accuracy. Experiments were conducted using the self-propelled pipeline robot in a rectangular loop pipeline, and the results verified the effectiveness of the proposed dead reckoning algorithm."}

Based on these issues, this study aims to formulate a comprehensive Islamic ethical framework that can serve as a more comprehensive preventative tool to mitigate the risks of misuse of deepfakes. The study employed a Systematic Literature Review (SLR) guided by PRISMA, selecting ten primary sources published between 2018 and 2025 to identify ethical deficiencies, regulatory needs, and appropriate normative solutions. The analysis shows that the integration of the principles of (Maqasid al-Shariah) particularly (hifz al-ird) protecting honor and (hifz al-nafs) protecting the self, provides a strong normative basis for regulating the responsible use of technology. This study yields three strategic recommendations: regulatory changes that recognize the intangible and psychological harm caused by reputational damage; improved technology management through moral scrutiny that upholds the values of justice (adl), trust, and openness; and increased public digital literacy based on the principle of (tabayyun) examination and caution.

The proposed method integrates OD flows with two complementary behavioral constraints: (1) dwell-travel time quantiles that are available only as coarse summary statistics and (2) the universal law for the daily distribution of the number of visited locations. Embedding these elements in a multi-objective optimization framework enables the reproduction of realistic distributions of human mobility while ensuring that no personal identifiers are required.\n  The proposed framework is validated in two contrasting regions of Japan: (1) the 23 special wards of Tokyo, representing a dense metropolitan environment; and (2) Fukuoka Prefecture, where urban and suburban mobility patterns coexist. The resulting synthetic mobility data reproduce dwell-travel time and visit frequency distributions with high fidelity, while deviations in OD consistency remain within the natural range of daily fluctuations.\n  The results of this study establish a practical synthesis pathway under real-world constraints, providing governments, urban planners, and industries with scalable access to high-resolution mobility data for reliable analytics without the need for sensitive personal records, and supporting practical deployments in policy and commercial domains."}

Even state-of-the-art models such as Whisper struggle to maintain accuracy under varying signal-to-noise ratios (SNRs). This study presents a robust noise-sensitive ASR error correction framework that combines multiple hypotheses and noise-aware modeling. Using noisy Persian speech, we generate 5-best hypotheses from a modified Whisper-large decoder. Error Level Noise (ELN) is introduced as a representation that captures semantic- and token-level disagreement across hypotheses, quantifying the linguistic distortions caused by noise. ELN thus provides a direct measure of noise-induced uncertainty, enabling the LLM to reason about the reliability of each hypothesis during correction. Three models are evaluated: (1) a base LLaMA-2-7B model without fine-tuning, (2) a fine-tuned variant trained on text-only hypotheses, and (3) a noise-conditioned model integrating ELN embeddings at both sentence and word levels. Experimental results demonstrate that the ELN-conditioned model achieves substantial reductions in Word Error Rate (WER). Specifically, on the challenging Mixed Noise test set, the proposed Fine-tuned + ELN (Ours) model reduces the WER from a baseline of 31.10\\% (Raw Whisper) to 24.84\\%, significantly surpassing the Fine-tuned (No ELN) text-only baseline of 30.79\\%, whereas the original LLaMA-2-7B model increased the WER to 64.58\\%, demonstrating that it is unable to correct Persian errors on its own. This confirms the effectiveness of combining multiple hypotheses with noise-aware embeddings for robust Persian ASR in noisy real-world scenarios."}

To bridge these gaps, we introduce an information-theoretic metric, named reasoning-based effective mutual information difference (R-EMID), to measure RPM performance degradation in an interpretable way. We also derive an upper bound on R-EMID to predict the worst-case generalization performance of RPMs and theoretically reveal how various shifts contribute to the RPM performance degradation. Moreover, we propose a co-evolving reinforcement learning framework to adaptively model the connection among user, character, and dialogue context and thus enhance the estimation of dialogue response generation probability, which is critical for calculating R-EMID.

The resulting model achieves the lowest Word Error Rate (WER) among all participating teams, while ranking second in perceptual metrics such as UTMOS and DNSMOS. These findings demonstrate that efficient, open-weight architectures like Supertonic can be effectively adapted to diverse real-world speech conditions when combined with explicit noise-handling mechanisms such as SPFM."}

M2RU achieves 15 GOPS at 48.62 mW, corresponding to 312 GOPS per watt, and maintains accuracy within 5 percent of software baselines on sequential MNIST and CIFAR-10 tasks. Compared with a CMOS digital design, the accelerator provides 29X improvement in energy efficiency. Device-aware analysis shows an expected operational lifetime of 12.2 years under continual learning workloads. These results establish M2RU as a scalable and energy-efficient platform for real-time adaptation in edge-level temporal intelligence."}

However, there is not a consistent definition or test to demonstrate inherent explainability. Work to date either characterises explainability through metrics, or appeals to intuition - \"we know it when we see it\". We propose a globally applicable criterion for inherent explainability. The criterion uses graph theory for representing and decomposing models for structure-local explanation, and recomposing them into global explanations. We form the structure-local explanations as annotations, a verifiable hypothesis-evidence structure that allows for a range of explanatory methods to be used. This criterion matches existing intuitions on inherent explainability, and provides justifications why a large regression model may not be explainable but a sparse neural network could be. We differentiate explainable -- a model that allows for explanation -- and \\textit{explained} -- one that has a verified explanation. Finally, we provide a full explanation of PREDICT -- a Cox proportional hazards model of cardiovascular disease risk, which is in active clinical use in New Zealand. It follows that PREDICT is inherently explainable. This work provides structure to formalise other work on explainability, and allows regulators a flexible but rigorous test that can be used in compliance frameworks."}

To enable faithful assessment, we introduce RSHR-Bench, a super-high-resolution benchmark for RS visual understanding and reasoning.

These tasks cover nine perception categories and four reasoning types, supporting multi-turn and multi-image dialog. To reduce reliance on language priors, we apply adversarial filtering with strong LLMs followed by rigorous human verification.

However, their deployment at the edge across distributed compute nodes (cloudlets) createssubstantial communication overhead due to repeated transmission of overlapping node features between neighbouring cloudlets. To address this, we propose an adaptive pruning algorithm that dynamically filters redundant neighbour features while preserving the most informative spatial context for prediction. The algorithm adjusts pruning rates based on recent model performance, allowing each cloudlet to focus on regions experiencing traffic changes without compromising accuracy. Additionally, we introduce the Sudden Event Prediction Accuracy (SEPA), a novel event-focused metric designed to measure responsiveness to traffic slowdowns and recoveries, which are often missed by standard error metrics. We evaluate our approach in an online semi-decentralized setting with traditional FL, server-free FL, and Gossip Learning on two large-scale traffic datasets, PeMS-BAY and PeMSD7-M, across short-, mid-, and long-term prediction horizons. Experiments show that, in contrast to standard metrics, SEPA exposes the true value of spatial connectivity in predicting dynamic and irregular traffic. Our adaptive pruning algorithm maintains prediction accuracy while significantly lowering communication cost in all online semi-decentralized settings, demonstrating that communication can be reduced without compromising responsiveness to critical traffic events."}

This misalignment often triggers driver-initiated takeovers and system disengagements during closed-loop execution. How to leverage those expert takeover data from disengagement scenarios and effectively expand the IL policy's capability presents a valuable yet unexplored challenge. In this paper, we propose TakeAD, a novel preference-based post-optimization framework that fine-tunes the pre-trained IL policy with this disengagement data to enhance the closed-loop driving performance. First, we design an efficient expert takeover data collection pipeline inspired by human takeover mechanisms in real-world autonomous driving systems. Then, this post optimization framework integrates iterative Dataset Aggregation (DAgger) for imitation learning with Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) for preference alignment. The DAgger stage equips the policy with fundamental capabilities to handle disengagement states through direct imitation of expert interventions. Subsequently, the DPO stage refines the policy's behavior to better align with expert preferences in disengagement scenarios. Through multiple iterations, the policy progressively learns recovery strategies for disengagement states, thereby mitigating the open-loop gap. Experiments on the closed-loop Bench2Drive benchmark demonstrate our method's effectiveness compared with pure IL methods, with comprehensive ablations confirming the contribution of each component."}

To overcome this, BSARec augments the Transformer encoder with a frequency layer that rescales high-frequency components using the Fourier transform. However, the overall effectiveness of BSARec and the roles of its individual components have yet to be systematically validated. We reproduce BSARec and show that it outperforms other SR methods on some datasets. To empirically assess whether BSARec improves performance on high-frequency signals, we propose a metric to quantify user history frequency and evaluate SR methods across different user groups. We compare digital signal processing (DSP) techniques and find that the discrete wavelet transform (DWT) offer only slight improvements over Fourier transforms, and DSP methods provide no clear advantage over simple residual connections. Finally, we explore padding strategies and find that non-constant padding significantly improves recommendation performance, whereas constant padding hinders the frequency rescaler's ability to capture high-frequency signals."}

Long-term electricity market mechanisms, including auctions, support schemes, and other policy instruments, are critical in shaping the electricity generation mix. In light of the need for more advanced tools to support policymakers and other stakeholders in designing, testing, and evaluating long-term markets, this work presents a multi-agent reinforcement learning model capable of capturing the key features of decarbonizing energy systems. Profit-maximizing generation companies make investment decisions in the wholesale electricity market, responding to system needs, competitive dynamics, and policy signals. The model employs independent proximal policy optimization, which was selected for suitability to the decentralized and competitive environment. Nevertheless, given the inherent challenges of independent learning in multi-agent settings, an extensive hyperparameter search ensures that decentralized training yields market outcomes consistent with competitive behavior. The model is applied to a stylized version of the Italian electricity system and tested under varying levels of competition, market designs, and policy scenarios. Results highlight the critical role of market design for decarbonizing the electricity sector and avoiding price volatility. The proposed framework allows assessing long-term electricity markets in which multiple policy and market mechanisms interact simultaneously, with market participants responding and adapting to decarbonization pathways."}

Based on real-world evidence from democratic innovations in participatory budgeting, in Switzerland and beyond, I highlight a trilogy of key research results: Fair voting methods achieve to be (i) legitimacy incubator, (ii) novel impact accelerator and (iii) safeguard for risks of artificial intelligence (AI). Compared to majoritarian voting methods, combining expressive ballot formats (e.g. cumulative voting) with ballot aggregation methods that promote proportional representation (e.g. equal shares) results in more winners and higher (geographical) representation of citizens. Such fair voting methods are preferred and found fairer even by voters who do not win, while promoting stronger democratic values for citizens such as altruism and compromise. They also result in new resourceful ideas to put for voting, which are cost-effective and win, especially in areas of welfare, education and culture. Strikingly, fair voting methods are also more resilient to biases and inconsistencies of generative AI in emerging scenarios of AI voting assistance or AI representation of voters who would be likely to abstain. I also review the relevance of such upgrades for democracies in crisis, such as the one of Greece featured in the recent study of `Unmute Democracy'. Greek democracy can build stronger resilience via higher representation of citizens in democratic processes as well as democratic innovations in participation. Fair voting methods can be a catalyst for both endeavors."}

K-OTG trains on a dual-path corpus: authorized examples (prefixed with a role key) learn the task output, while unauthorized examples learn a visible block token. At inference, a pre-lm_head hook applies an orthonormal transform to the hidden state: with the correct key/role the inverse map restores the model's native basis; otherwise a session-ephemeral scrambler (permutation, sign flips, Householders) makes logits uninformative and the system short-circuits to BLOCK. Keys are not added as special tokens, and the method composes cleanly with LoRA on 4-bit bases. We evaluate an hour-scale protocol on 1-3B-class instruction models (Llama 3.2, Qwen2.5 1.5B) across utility (XSum ROUGE/BLEU, GSM8K accuracy, WikiText-2 perplexity), selectivity (3by3 role-key unlock matrices), nonce invariance, block suppression, and throughput. Authorized utility remains close to the base on summarization with the expected modest PPL increase from instruction tuning; unauthorized utility collapses (near-zero sequence metrics with exploding PPL), indicating practical unusability without the key. Unlock matrices are diagonally dominant (high on-target unlock, low cross-unlock), authorized block emission is 0 per N via robust bad-word lists, and greedy outputs match exactly across nonces, confirming correct inverse cancellation. The runtime overhead of the Python-level hook is 40% tokens per sec versus the base. K-OTG therefore provides a pragmatic, model-agnostic way to prevent unauthorized use while preserving authorized utility."}

Effective flow control can lead to, e.g., lift increase, drag reduction, mixing enhancement, and noise reduction. However, controlling a fluid faces several significant challenges, including high-dimensional, nonlinear, and multiscale interactions in space and time. Reinforcement learning (RL) has recently shown great success in complex domains, such as robotics and protein folding, but its application to flow control is hindered by a lack of standardized benchmark platforms and the computational demands of fluid simulations. To address these challenges, we introduce HydroGym, a solver-independent RL platform for flow control research. HydroGym integrates sophisticated flow control benchmarks, scalable runtime infrastructure, and state-of-the-art RL algorithms. Our platform includes 42 validated environments spanning from canonical laminar flows to complex three-dimensional turbulent scenarios, validated over a wide range of Reynolds numbers. We provide non-differentiable solvers for traditional RL and differentiable solvers that dramatically improve sample efficiency through gradient-enhanced optimization. Comprehensive evaluation reveals that RL agents consistently discover robust control principles across configurations, such as boundary layer manipulation, acoustic feedback disruption, and wake reorganization. Transfer learning studies demonstrate that controllers learned at one Reynolds number or geometry adapt efficiently to new conditions, requiring approximately 50% fewer training episodes. The HydroGym platform is highly extensible and scalable, providing a framework for researchers in fluid dynamics, machine learning, and control to add environments, surrogate models, and control algorithms to advance science and technology."}

However, current methods mainly focus on handling humans wearing tight clothing and perform poorly when estimating body shapes and poses under diverse clothing, especially loose garments. To this end, we make two key insights: (1) tailoring clothing to fit the human body can mitigate the adverse impact of clothing on 3D human mesh recovery, and (2) utilizing human visual information from large foundational models can enhance the generalization ability of the estimation. Based on these insights, we propose ClothHMR, to accurately recover 3D meshes of humans in diverse clothing. ClothHMR primarily consists of two modules: clothing tailoring (CT) and FHVM-based mesh recovering (MR). The CT module employs body semantic estimation and body edge prediction to tailor the clothing, ensuring it fits the body silhouette. The MR module optimizes the initial parameters of the 3D human mesh by continuously aligning the intermediate representations of the 3D mesh with those inferred from the foundational human visual model (FHVM). ClothHMR can accurately recover 3D meshes of humans wearing diverse clothing, precisely estimating their body shapes and poses. Experimental results demonstrate that ClothHMR significantly outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods across benchmark datasets and in-the-wild images. Additionally, a web application for online fashion and shopping powered by ClothHMR is developed, illustrating that ClothHMR can effectively serve real-world usage scenarios.

However, the effectiveness of these techniques cannot be taken for granted in the case of modern large-scale ASR models trained on diverse, noisy data. We present a systematic evaluation of MetricGAN-plus-voicebank denoising on four state-of-the-art ASR systems: OpenAI Whisper, NVIDIA Parakeet, Google Gemini Flash 2.0, Parrotlet-a using 500 medical speech recordings under nine noise conditions. ASR performance is measured using semantic WER (semWER), a normalized word error rate (WER) metric accounting for domain-specific normalizations. Our results reveal a counterintuitive finding: speech enhancement preprocessing degrades ASR performance across all noise conditions and models. Original noisy audio achieves lower semWER than enhanced audio in all 40 tested configurations (4 models x 10 conditions), with degradations ranging from 1.1% to 46.6% absolute semWER increase. These findings suggest that modern ASR models possess sufficient internal noise robustness and that traditional speech enhancement may remove acoustic features critical for ASR. For practitioners deploying medical scribe systems in noisy clinical environments, our results indicate that preprocessing audio with noise reduction techniques might not just be computationally wasteful but also be potentially harmful to the transcription accuracy."}

Most existing deep learning based malware detectors rely on closed world assumptions and fail to adequately model this intra class variation, resulting in degraded performance when confronted with previously unseen malware families. This paper presents MADOOD, a novel two stage, cluster driven deep learning framework for robust OOD malware detection and classification. In the first stage, malware family embeddings are modeled using class conditional spherical decision boundaries derived from Gaussian Discriminant Analysis (GDA), enabling statistically grounded separation of indistribution and OOD samples without requiring OOD data during training. Z score based distance analysis across multiple class centroids is employed to reliably identify anomalous samples in the latent space. In the second stage, a deep neural network integrates cluster based predictions, refined embeddings, and supervised classifier outputs to enhance final classification accuracy. Extensive evaluations on benchmark malware datasets comprising 25 known families and multiple novel OOD variants demonstrate that MADOOD significantly outperforms state of the art OOD detection methods, achieving an AUC of up to 0.911 on unseen malware families. The proposed framework provides a scalable, interpretable, and statistically principled solution for real world malware detection and anomaly identification in evolving cybersecurity environments."}

This makes MGRegBench one of the largest public 2D registration datasets with manual annotations.

Nevertheless, we find that both approaches exhibit notable trade-offs and inconsistent performance across PDE types. To address this issue, we develop a hybrid strategy that combines the strengths of hard and easy prioritization through an alternating training algorithm. On PDEs with steep gradients, nonlinearity, and high dimensionality, the proposed method achieves consistently high accuracy, with relative L2 errors mostly in the range of O(10^-5) to O(10^-6), significantly surpassing baseline methods. Moreover, it offers greater reliability across diverse problems, whereas compared approaches often suffer from variable accuracy depending on the PDE.

In realistic settings, interventions are rarely isolated: organizations need to align sequences of interventions to jointly steer the outcome of a case. Existing PresPM approaches fall short in this respect. Many focus on a single intervention decision, while others treat multiple interventions independently, ignoring how they interact over time. Methods that do address these dependencies depend either on simulation or data augmentation to approximate the process to train a Reinforcement Learning (RL) agent, which can create a reality gap and introduce bias. We introduce SCOPE, a PresPM approach that learns aligned sequential intervention recommendations. SCOPE employs backward induction to estimate the effect of each candidate intervention action, propagating its impact from the final decision point back to the first. By leveraging causal learners, our method can utilize observational data directly, unlike methods that require constructing process approximations for reinforcement learning. Experiments on both an existing synthetic dataset and a new semi-synthetic dataset show that SCOPE consistently outperforms state-of-the-art PresPM techniques in optimizing the KPI.

An adaptive prefix-selection mechanism further allocates expert guidance based on measured utility. Experiments on five mathematical reasoning benchmarks show that TRAPO consistently surpasses standard SFT, RL, and SFT-then-RL pipelines, as well as recent state-of-the-art approaches, establishing a strong new paradigm for reasoning-enhanced LLMs."}

We address these limitations by reformulating WF as a zero-shot cross-modal retrieval problem and introducing STAR. STAR learns a joint embedding space for encrypted traffic traces and crawl-time logic profiles using a dual-encoder architecture. Trained on 150K automatically collected traffic-logic pairs with contrastive and consistency objectives and structure-aware augmentation, STAR retrieves the most semantically aligned profile for a trace without requiring target-side traffic during training. Experiments on 1,600 unseen websites show that STAR achieves 87.9 percent top-1 accuracy and 0.963 AUC in open-world detection, outperforming supervised and few-shot baselines. Adding an adapter with only four labeled traces per site further boosts top-5 accuracy to 98.8 percent. Our analysis reveals intrinsic semantic-traffic alignment in modern web protocols, identifying semantic leakage as the dominant privacy risk in encrypted HTTPS traffic.

The fused features are then treated as a spatial sequence, allowing for the capture of an intra-frame context, which is then propagated through time to model inter-frame dynamics. We evaluated our method on the EVE dataset and show that ST-Gaze achieves state-of-the-art performance both with and without person-specific adaptation.

In this work, we present YOTO (you only train once), an end-to-end framework that jointly identifies discrete gene subsets and performs prediction within a single differentiable architecture. In our model, the prediction task directly guides which genes are selected, while the learned subsets, in turn, shape the predictive representation. This closed feedback loop enables the model to iteratively refine both what it selects and how it predicts during training. Unlike existing approaches, YOTO enforces sparsity so that only the selected genes contribute to inference, eliminating the need to train additional downstream classifiers. Through a multi-task learning design, the model learns shared representations across related objectives, allowing partially labeled datasets to inform one another, and discovering gene subsets that generalize across tasks without additional training steps. We evaluate YOTO on two representative single-cell RNA-seq datasets, showing that it consistently outperforms state-of-the-art baselines.

Meanwhile, although diversity is acknowledged as a key aspect of recommendation quality, existing research offers limited attention to it, with a notable lack of causal perspectives and theoretical grounding. To address these challenges, we propose Cadence: Diversity Recommendation via Causal Deconfounding of Co-purchase Relations and Counterfactual Exposure - a plug-and-play framework built upon LightGCN as the backbone, primarily designed to enhance recommendation diversity while preserving accuracy. First, we compute the Unbiased Asymmetric Co-purchase Relationship (UACR) between items - excluding item popularity and user attributes - to construct a deconfounded directed item graph, with an aggregation mechanism to refine embeddings. Second, we leverage UACR to identify diverse categories of items that exhibit strong causal relevance to a user's interacted items but have not yet been engaged with. We then simulate their behavior under high-exposure scenarios, thereby significantly enhancing recommendation diversity while preserving relevance. Extensive experiments on real-world datasets demonstrate that our method consistently outperforms state-of-the-art diversity models in both diversity and accuracy, and further validates its effectiveness, transferability, and efficiency over baselines."}

Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT) has emerged as a critical approach for effectively adapting LMs to a diverse range of downstream tasks. However, existing PEFT methods face two primary challenges: (1) High resource cost. Although PEFT methods significantly reduce resource demands compared to full fine-tuning, it still requires substantial time and memory, making it impractical in resource-constrained environments. (2) Parameter dependency. PEFT methods heavily rely on updating a subset of parameters associated with LMs to incorporate task-specific knowledge. Yet, due to increasing competition in the LMs landscape, many companies have adopted closed-source policies for their leading models, offering access only via Application Programming Interface (APIs). Whereas, the expense is often cost-prohibitive and difficult to sustain, as the fine-tuning process of LMs is extremely slow. Even if small models perform far worse than LMs in general, they can achieve superior results on particular distributions while requiring only minimal resources. Motivated by this insight, we propose Easy Adaptation (EA), which designs Specific Small Models (SSMs) to complement the underfitted data distribution for LMs. Extensive experiments show that EA matches the performance of PEFT on diverse tasks without accessing LM parameters, and requires only minimal resources."}

However, fitting NPHMs to visual inputs is notoriously challenging due to the expressive nature of their underlying latent space. To this end, we propose Pix2NPHM, a vision transformer (ViT) network that directly regresses NPHM parameters, given a single image as input. Compared to existing approaches, the neural parametric space allows our method to reconstruct more recognizable facial geometry and accurate facial expressions. For broad generalization, we exploit domain-specific ViTs as backbones, which are pretrained on geometric prediction tasks. We train Pix2NPHM on a mixture of 3D data, including a total of over 100K NPHM registrations that enable direct supervision in SDF space, and large-scale 2D video datasets, for which normal estimates serve as pseudo ground truth geometry. Pix2NPHM not only allows for 3D reconstructions at interactive frame rates, it is also possible to improve geometric fidelity by a subsequent inference-time optimization against estimated surface normals and canonical point maps. As a result, we achieve unprecedented face reconstruction quality that can run at scale on in-the-wild data."}

However, existing efforts focus primarily on increasing dataset size and overlook the question of whether the backbone network is an effective representation learner at scale. In this work, we address this gap by revisiting ConvNeXt-based architectures for volumetric segmentation and introducing MedNeXt-v2, a compound-scaled 3D ConvNeXt that leverages improved micro-architecture and data scaling to deliver state-of-the-art performance. First, we show that routinely used backbones in large-scale pretraining pipelines are often suboptimal. Subsequently, we use comprehensive backbone benchmarking prior to scaling and demonstrate that stronger from scratch performance reliably predicts stronger downstream performance after pretraining. Guided by these findings, we incorporate a 3D Global Response Normalization module and use depth, width, and context scaling to improve our architecture for effective representation learning. We pretrain MedNeXt-v2 on 18k CT volumes and demonstrate state-of-the-art performance when fine-tuning across six challenging CT and MR benchmarks (144 structures), showing consistent gains over seven publicly released pretrained models. Beyond improvements, our benchmarking of these models also reveals that stronger backbones yield better results on similar data, representation scaling disproportionately benefits pathological segmentation, and that modality-specific pretraining offers negligible benefit once full finetuning is applied. In conclusion, our results establish MedNeXt-v2 as a strong backbone for large-scale supervised representation learning in 3D Medical Image Segmentation.

In this work, we introduce AniX, leveraging the realism and structural grounding of static world generation while extending controllable-entity models to support user-specified characters capable of performing open-ended actions. Users can provide a 3DGS scene and a character, then direct the character through natural language to perform diverse behaviors from basic locomotion to object-centric interactions while freely exploring the environment. AniX synthesizes temporally coherent video clips that preserve visual fidelity with the provided scene and character, formulated as a conditional autoregressive video generation problem. Built upon a pre-trained video generator, our training strategy significantly enhances motion dynamics while maintaining generalization across actions and characters. Our evaluation covers a broad range of aspects, including visual quality, character consistency, action controllability, and long-horizon coherence."}

Instead of learning a policy or explicit planner, PaD learns a goal-conditioned energy function over entire latent trajectories, assigning low energy to feasible, goal-consistent futures. Planning is realized as gradient-based refinement in this energy landscape, using identical computation during training and inference to reduce train-test mismatch common in decoupled modeling pipelines.\n  PaD is trained via self-supervised hindsight goal relabeling, shaping the energy landscape around the planning dynamics. At inference, multiple trajectory candidates are refined under different temporal hypotheses, and low-energy plans balancing feasibility and efficiency are selected.\n  We evaluate PaD on OGBench cube manipulation tasks. When trained on narrow expert demonstrations, PaD achieves state-of-the-art 95\\% success, strongly outperforming prior methods that peak at 68\\%. Remarkably, training on noisy, suboptimal data further improves success and plan efficiency, highlighting the benefits of verification-driven planning.

The depth and context from traditionally qualitative methods such as participant observation, in-depth interviews, and historical documents are increasingly employed alongside scalable data management, computational text analysis, and open-science practices. Machine learning (ML) and natural language processing (NLP), provide resources to aggregate and systematically index large volumes of qualitative data, identify patterns, and maintain clear links to in-depth accounts. Drawing on case studies of projects that examine later life--including examples with original data from the DISCERN study (a team-based ethnography of life with dementia) and secondary analyses of the American Voices Project (nationally representative interview)--the chapter highlights both uses and challenges of bringing CSS tools into more meaningful dialogue with qualitative aging research. The chapter argues such work has potential for (1) streamlining and augmenting existing workflows, (2) scaling up samples and projects, and (3) generating multi-method approaches to address important questions in new ways, before turning to practices useful for individuals and teams seeking to understand current possibilities or refine their workflow processes. The chapter concludes that current developments are not without peril, but offer potential for new insights into aging and the life course by broadening--rather than replacing--the methodological foundations of qualitative research."}

Proposed loss leverages different levels of cross-attention maps extracted from the backbone decoder to enforce accurate object placement and a balanced object presence during sampling.

These methods are typically formulated via overdamped or underdamped Ornstein--Uhlenbeck-type stochastic differential equations, in which sampling is driven by a combination of deterministic drift and Brownian diffusion, resulting in continuous particle trajectories in the ambient space. While such dynamics enjoy exponential convergence guarantees for strongly log-concave target distributions, it is well known that their mixing rates deteriorate exponentially in the presence of nonconvex or multimodal landscapes, such as double-well potentials. Since many practical generative modeling tasks involve highly non-log-concave target distributions, considerable recent effort has been devoted to developing sampling schemes that improve exploration beyond classical diffusion dynamics.\n  A promising line of work leverages tools from information geometry to augment diffusion-based samplers with controlled mass reweighting mechanisms. This perspective leads naturally to Wasserstein--Fisher--Rao (WFR) geometries, which couple transport in the sample space with vertical (reaction) dynamics on the space of probability measures. In this work, we formulate such reweighting mechanisms through the introduction of explicit correction terms and show how they can be implemented via weighted stochastic differential equations using the Feynman--Kac representation. Our study provides a preliminary but rigorous investigation of WFR-based sampling dynamics, and aims to clarify their geometric and operator-theoretic structure as a foundation for future theoretical and algorithmic developments."}

We use a fully solvable one-dimensional Ising model to show that local basis rotations leave the loss landscape unchanged while relocating the exact wavefunction in parameter space, effectively increasing its geometric distance from typical initializations. By sweeping a rotation angle, we compute quantum Fisher information and Fubini-Study distances to quantify how the rotated wavefunction moves within the loss landscape. Shallow architectures (with focus on Restricted Boltzmann Machines (RBMs)) trained with quantum natural gradient are more likely to fall into saddle-point regions depending on the rotation angle: they achieve low energy error but fail to reproduce correct coefficient distributions. In the ferromagnetic case, near-degenerate eigenstates create high-curvature barriers that trap optimization at intermediate fidelities. We introduce a framework based on an analytically solvable rotated Ising model to investigate how relocating the target wavefunction within a fixed loss landscape exposes information-geometric barriers,such as saddle points and high-curvature regions,that hinder shallow NQS optimization, underscoring the need for landscape-aware model design in variational training."}

A lightweight recovery step reconstructs point clouds from the generated maps. To better align generation with the visual scene, RadarGen incorporates BEV-aligned depth, semantic, and motion cues extracted from pretrained foundation models, which guide the stochastic generation process toward physically plausible radar patterns.

These are tested for untargeted PGD (Projected Gradient Descent) against the visual input modality, and empirically evaluated on the Visual Question Answering (VQA) v2 dataset subset. The results of these adversarial attacks are then quantified using the standard VQA accuracy metric. This evaluation is then compared with the accuracy degradation (accuracy drop) of LLaVA and Llama 3.2 Vision. A key finding is that Llama 3.2 Vision, despite a lower baseline accuracy in this setup, exhibited a smaller drop in performance under attack compared to LLaVA, particularly at higher perturbation levels. Overall, the findings confirm that the vision modality represents a viable attack vector for degrading the performance of contemporary open-weight VLMs, including Meta's Llama 3.2 Vision.
