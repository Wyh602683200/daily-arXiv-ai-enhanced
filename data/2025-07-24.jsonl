This approach\nreduces weeks or months of expert time to under one minute and closes data\navailability gaps while yielding carbon footprint estimates within 19% of\nexpert LCAs with zero proprietary data. Additionally, we develop a method to\ndirectly estimate EI by comparing an input to a cluster of products with\nsimilar descriptions and known carbon footprints. This runs in 3 ms on a laptop\nwith a MAPE of 12.28% on electronic products. Further, we develop a data-driven\nmethod to generate emission factors.

Its objective\nis to minimize the sum of path costs (SOC), where the path cost of each agent\nis defined as the travel time from its start location to its target location.\nExplicit Estimation Conflict-Based Search (EECBS) is the leading algorithm for\nbounded-suboptimal MAPF, with the SOC of the solution being at most a\nuser-specified factor $w$ away from optimal. EECBS maintains sets of paths and\na lower bound $LB$ on the optimal SOC. Then, it iteratively selects a set of\npaths whose SOC is at most $w \\cdot LB$ and introduces constraints to resolve\ncollisions. For each path in a set, EECBS maintains a lower bound on its\noptimal path that satisfies constraints. By finding an individually\nbounded-suboptimal path with cost at most a threshold of $w$ times its lower\nbound, EECBS guarantees to find a bounded-suboptimal solution. To speed up\nEECBS, previous work uses flex distribution to increase the threshold. Though\nEECBS with flex distribution guarantees to find a bounded-suboptimal solution,\nincreasing the thresholds may push the SOC beyond $w \\cdot LB$, forcing EECBS\nto switch among different sets of paths instead of resolving collisions on a\nparticular set of paths, and thus reducing efficiency. To address this issue,\nwe propose Conflict-Based Flex Distribution that distributes flex in proportion\nto the number of collisions. We also estimate the delays needed to satisfy\nconstraints and propose Delay-Based Flex Distribution. On top of that, we\npropose Mixed-Strategy Flex Distribution, combining both in a hierarchical\nframework. We prove that EECBS with our new flex distribution mechanisms is\ncomplete and bounded-suboptimal. Our experiments show that our approaches\noutperform the original (greedy) flex distribution."}

The root cause of this misalignment lies in\nprojection errors, stemming from minor extrinsic calibration inaccuracies and\nrolling shutter effect of LiDAR during vehicle motion. In this work, our key\ninsight is that these projection errors are predominantly concentrated at\nobject-background boundaries, which are readily identified by 2D detectors.\nBased on this, our main motivation is to utilize 2D object priors to pre-align\ncross-modal features before fusion. To address local misalignment, we propose\nPrior Guided Depth Calibration (PGDC), which leverages 2D priors to correct\nlocal misalignment and preserve correct cross-modal feature pairs. To resolve\nglobal misalignment, we introduce Discontinuity Aware Geometric Fusion (DAGF)\nto process calibrated results from PGDC, suppressing noise and explicitly\nenhancing sharp transitions at object-background boundaries. To effectively\nutilize these transition-aware depth representations, we incorporate Structural\nGuidance Depth Modulator (SGDM), using a gated attention mechanism to\nefficiently fuse aligned depth and image features. Our proposed method achieves\nstate-of-the-art performance on nuScenes validation dataset, with its mAP and\nNDS reaching 71.5% and 73.6% respectively."}

While it is\noften assumed that RL fine-tuning requires updating most of a model's\nparameters, we challenge this assumption with a surprising finding: RL\nfine-tuning consistently modifies only a small subnetwork (typically 5-30% of\nweights), leaving most parameters unchanged. We call this phenomenon RL-induced\nparameter update sparsity. It arises naturally, without any sparsity\nconstraints or parameter-efficient tuning, and appears across multiple RL\nalgorithms (e.g., PPO, DPO, SimPO, PRIME) and model families (e.g., OpenAI,\nMeta, and open-source LLMs). Moreover, the subnetworks updated by RL show\nsubstantial overlap across different seeds, datasets, and algorithms-far\nexceeding chance-suggesting a partially transferable structure in the\npretrained model. We show that fine-tuning only this sparse subnetwork recovers\nfull model performance and yields parameters nearly identical to the fully\nfine-tuned model. Our analysis suggests this sparsity emerges because RL\noperates near the model's original distribution, requiring only targeted\nchanges. KL penalties, gradient clipping, and on-policy dynamics have limited\neffect on the sparsity pattern.

Although recent studies have explored\nheterogeneous SL frameworks that optimize split points for devices with varying\nresource constraints, they often neglect personalized privacy requirements and\nlocal model customization under varying environmental conditions. To address\nthese limitations, we propose P3SL, a Personalized Privacy-Preserving Split\nLearning framework designed for heterogeneous, resource-constrained edge device\nsystems.

Recent advances in Vision Transformers (ViTs) have\ndemonstrated remarkable capabilities in computer vision tasks, yet their\nalignment with human visual attention patterns remains underexplored,\nparticularly in aesthetic contexts. This study investigates the correlation\nbetween human visual attention and ViT attention mechanisms when evaluating\nhandcrafted objects. We conducted an eye-tracking experiment with 30\nparticipants (9 female, 21 male, mean age 24.6 years) who viewed 20 artisanal\nobjects comprising basketry bags and ginger jars. Using a Pupil Labs\neye-tracker, we recorded gaze patterns and generated heat maps representing\nhuman visual attention. Simultaneously, we analyzed the same objects using a\npre-trained ViT model with DINO (Self-DIstillation with NO Labels), extracting\nattention maps from each of the 12 attention heads. We compared human and ViT\nattention distributions using Kullback-Leibler divergence across varying\nGaussian parameters (sigma=0.1 to 3.0). Statistical analysis revealed optimal\ncorrelation at sigma=2.4 +-0.03, with attention head #12 showing the strongest\nalignment with human visual patterns. Significant differences were found\nbetween attention heads, with heads #7 and #9 demonstrating the greatest\ndivergence from human attention (p< 0.05, Tukey HSD test). Results indicate\nthat while ViTs exhibit more global attention patterns compared to human focal\nattention, certain attention heads can approximate human visual behavior,\nparticularly for specific object features like buckles in basketry items. These\nfindings suggest potential applications of ViT attention mechanisms in product\ndesign and aesthetic evaluation, while highlighting fundamental differences in\nattention strategies between human perception and current AI models."}

In this work, we develop a principled framework to analyze how\ndifferent forms of compressibility - such as neuron-level sparsity and spectral\ncompressibility - affect adversarial robustness. We show that these forms of\ncompression can induce a small number of highly sensitive directions in the\nrepresentation space, which adversaries can exploit to construct effective\nperturbations. Our analysis yields a simple yet instructive robustness bound,\nrevealing how neuron and spectral compressibility impact $L_\\infty$ and $L_2$\nrobustness via their effects on the learned representations.

By forcing multi-round argumentation, this approach\nsubstantially increases difficulty while penalizing shallow memorization, yet\nreuses QA items to reduce curation overhead. We make two main contributions:\n(1) an evaluation pipeline to systematically convert QA tasks into debate-based\nassessments, and (2) a public benchmark that demonstrates our paradigm's\neffectiveness on a subset of MMLU-Pro questions, complete with standardized\nprotocols and reference models. Empirical results validate the robustness of\nthe method and its effectiveness against data contamination--a Llama 3.1 model\nfine-tuned on test questions showed dramatic accuracy improvements (50% -> 82%)\nbut performed worse in debates.
