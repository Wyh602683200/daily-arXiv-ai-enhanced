To test this, we first\nprompt LLMs to reason explicitly about CI when deciding what information to\ndisclose. We then extend this approach by developing a reinforcement learning\n(RL) framework that further instills in models the reasoning necessary to\nachieve CI. Using a synthetic, automatically created, dataset of only $\\sim700$\nexamples but with diverse contexts and information disclosure norms, we show\nthat our method substantially reduces inappropriate information disclosure\nwhile maintaining task performance across multiple model sizes and families.\nImportantly, improvements transfer from this synthetic dataset to established\nCI benchmarks such as PrivacyLens that has human annotations and evaluates\nprivacy leakage of AI assistants in actions and tool calls."}

To\naddress this, we propose a novel automatic skill discovery framework EXIF for\nLLM-powered agents, designed to improve the feasibility of generated target\nbehaviors while accounting for the agents' capabilities.

VAR\nreformulates autoregressive modeling by decomposing an image into successive\nresolution scales. During inference, an image is generated by predicting all\nthe tokens in the next (higher-resolution) scale, conditioned on all tokens in\nall previous (lower-resolution) scales. However, this formulation suffers from\nreduced image quality due to the parallel generation of all tokens in a\nresolution scale; has sequence lengths scaling superlinearly in image\nresolution; and requires retraining to change the sampling schedule.\n  We introduce Hierarchical Masked Auto-Regressive modeling (HMAR), a new image\ngeneration algorithm that alleviates these issues using next-scale prediction\nand masked prediction to generate high-quality images with fast sampling. HMAR\nreformulates next-scale prediction as a Markovian process, wherein the\nprediction of each resolution scale is conditioned only on tokens in its\nimmediate predecessor instead of the tokens in all predecessor resolutions.\nWhen predicting a resolution scale, HMAR uses a controllable multi-step masked\ngeneration procedure to generate a subset of the tokens in each step. On\nImageNet 256x256 and 512x512 benchmarks, HMAR models match or outperform\nparameter-matched VAR, diffusion, and autoregressive baselines.

Finally,\nHMAR yields additional flexibility over VAR; its sampling schedule can be\nchanged without further training, and it can be applied to image editing tasks\nin a zero-shot manner."}

Among the various technologies driving this transformation, Large\nLanguage Models (LLMs) have emerged as powerful tools for creating educational\nmaterials and question answering, but there are still space for new\napplications. Educators commonly use Multiple-Choice Questions (MCQs) to assess\nstudent knowledge, but manually generating these questions is\nresource-intensive and requires significant time and cognitive effort. In our\nopinion, LLMs offer a promising solution to these challenges. This paper\npresents a novel comparative analysis of three widely known LLMs - Llama 2,\nMistral, and GPT-3.5 - to explore their potential for creating informative and\nchallenging MCQs. In our approach, we do not rely on the knowledge of the LLM,\nbut we inject the knowledge into the prompt to contrast the hallucinations,\ngiving the educators control over the test's source text, too. Our experiment\ninvolving 21 educators shows that GPT-3.5 generates the most effective MCQs\nacross several known metrics. Additionally, it shows that there is still some\nreluctance to adopt AI in the educational field. This study sheds light on the\npotential of LLMs to generate MCQs and improve the educational experience,\nproviding valuable insights for the future."}

And yet despite\nthe wide-ranging applicability, there have been relatively few changes to SAEs\nbeyond the original recipe from decades ago, namely, standard deep\nencoder/decoder layers trained with a classical/deterministic sparse\nregularizer applied within the latent space. One possible exception is the\nvariational autoencoder (VAE), which adopts a stochastic encoder module capable\nof producing sparse representations when applied to manifold data. In this work\nwe formalize underappreciated weaknesses with both canonical SAEs, as well as\nanalogous VAEs applied to similar tasks, and propose a hybrid alternative model\nthat circumvents these prior limitations.

To enable explicit spatial\nreasoning and help the model grasp basic principles of object placement, we\nemploy Chain-of-Thought (CoT) Activation based on the 3D-Front dataset.\nAdditionally, we design CoT-Grounded Generative Layout Reward to enhance\ngeneralization and spatial planning. During inference, DirectLayout addresses\nasset-layout mismatches via Iterative Asset-Layout Alignment through in-context\nlearning. Extensive experiments demonstrate that DirectLayout achieves\nimpressive semantic consistency, generalization and physical plausibility."}

We first curate,\nstandardize, and share 9 datasets containing 9 antigens (involving influenza,\nanti-lysozyme, HER2, VEGF, integrin, and SARS-CoV-2) and 155,853 heavy chain\nmutated antibodies.

Prior works focus on appearance-based or motion-based cues\nof the puck without explicitly modelling the cues derived from player\nbehaviour. Players consistently turn their bodies and direct their gaze toward\nthe puck. Motivated by this strong contextual cue, we propose Puck Localization\nUsing Contextual Cues (PLUCC), a novel approach for scale-aware and\ncontext-driven single-frame puck detections. PLUCC consists of three\ncomponents: (a) a contextual encoder, which utilizes player orientations and\npositioning as helpful priors; (b) a feature pyramid encoder, which extracts\nmultiscale features from the dual encoders; and (c) a gating decoder that\ncombines latent features with a channel gating mechanism. For evaluation, in\naddition to standard average precision, we propose Rink Space Localization\nError (RSLE), a scale-invariant homography-based metric for removing\nperspective bias from rink space evaluation. The experimental results of PLUCC\non the PuckDataset dataset demonstrated state-of-the-art detection performance,\nsurpassing previous baseline methods by an average precision improvement of\n12.2% and RSLE average precision of 25%.

VAR\nreformulates autoregressive modeling by decomposing an image into successive\nresolution scales. During inference, an image is generated by predicting all\nthe tokens in the next (higher-resolution) scale, conditioned on all tokens in\nall previous (lower-resolution) scales. However, this formulation suffers from\nreduced image quality due to the parallel generation of all tokens in a\nresolution scale; has sequence lengths scaling superlinearly in image\nresolution; and requires retraining to change the sampling schedule.\n  We introduce Hierarchical Masked Auto-Regressive modeling (HMAR), a new image\ngeneration algorithm that alleviates these issues using next-scale prediction\nand masked prediction to generate high-quality images with fast sampling. HMAR\nreformulates next-scale prediction as a Markovian process, wherein the\nprediction of each resolution scale is conditioned only on tokens in its\nimmediate predecessor instead of the tokens in all predecessor resolutions.\nWhen predicting a resolution scale, HMAR uses a controllable multi-step masked\ngeneration procedure to generate a subset of the tokens in each step.

To address this, denoising\nlow-statistics MC dose maps is proposed to enable fast, high-quality dose\ngeneration.\n  Methods: We developed a diffusion transformer-based denoising framework. IMPT\nplans and 3D CT images from 80 H&N patients were used to generate noisy and\nhigh-statistics dose maps using MCsquare (1 min and 10 min per plan,\nrespectively). Data were standardized into uniform chunks with zero-padding,\nnormalized, and transformed into quasi-Gaussian distributions. Testing was done\non 10 H&N, 10 lung, 10 breast, and 10 prostate cancer cases, preprocessed\nidentically. The model was trained with noisy dose maps and CT images as input\nand high-statistics dose maps as ground truth, using a combined loss of mean\nsquare error (MSE), residual loss, and regional MAE (focusing on top/bottom 10%\ndose voxels). Performance was assessed via MAE, 3D Gamma passing rate, and DVH\nindices.\n  Results: The model achieved MAEs of 0.195 (H&N), 0.120 (lung), 0.172\n(breast), and 0.376 Gy[RBE] (prostate). 3D Gamma passing rates exceeded 92%\n(3%/2mm) across all sites. DVH indices for clinical target volumes (CTVs) and\nOARs closely matched the ground truth.\n  Conclusion: A diffusion transformer-based denoising framework was developed\nand, though trained only on H&N data, generalizes well across multiple disease\nsites."}

A unique feature of this approach is that\ntransformations between two sensory inputs are learned to satisfy algebraic\nstructural constraints. Conventional representation learning often assumes that\ndisentangled independent feature axes is a good representation; however, we\nfound that such a representation cannot account for conditional independence.\nTo overcome this problem, we proposed a new method using group decomposition in\nGalois algebra theory. Although this method is promising for defining a more\ngeneral representation, it assumes pixel-to-pixel translation without feature\nextraction, and can only process low-resolution images with no background,\nwhich prevents real-world application. In this study, we provide a simple\nmethod to apply our group decomposition theory to a more realistic scenario by\ncombining feature extraction and object segmentation. We replace pixel\ntranslation with feature translation and formulate object segmentation as\ngrouping features under the same transformation. We validated the proposed\nmethod on a practical dataset containing both real-world object and background.\nWe believe that our model will lead to a better understanding of human\ndevelopment of object recognition in the real world."}

However,\ncurrent synthetic data generation methods struggle with issues, such as\nmultiple objects per mask, inaccurate segmentation, and incorrect category\nlabels, limiting their effectiveness. To address these issues, we introduce\nGen-n-Val, a novel agentic data generation framework that leverages Layer\nDiffusion (LD), LLMs, and VLLMs to produce high-quality, single-object masks\nand diverse backgrounds. Gen-n-Val consists of two agents: (1) The LD prompt\nagent, an LLM, optimizes prompts for LD to generate high-quality foreground\ninstance images and segmentation masks. These optimized prompts ensure the\ngeneration of single-object synthetic data with precise instance masks and\nclean backgrounds. (2) The data validation agent, a VLLM, which filters out\nlow-quality synthetic instance images. The system prompts for both agents are\nrefined through TextGrad. Additionally, we use image harmonization to combine\nmultiple instances within scenes.

Among the various technologies driving this transformation, Large\nLanguage Models (LLMs) have emerged as powerful tools for creating educational\nmaterials and question answering, but there are still space for new\napplications. Educators commonly use Multiple-Choice Questions (MCQs) to assess\nstudent knowledge, but manually generating these questions is\nresource-intensive and requires significant time and cognitive effort. In our\nopinion, LLMs offer a promising solution to these challenges. This paper\npresents a novel comparative analysis of three widely known LLMs - Llama 2,\nMistral, and GPT-3.5 - to explore their potential for creating informative and\nchallenging MCQs. In our approach, we do not rely on the knowledge of the LLM,\nbut we inject the knowledge into the prompt to contrast the hallucinations,\ngiving the educators control over the test's source text, too. Our experiment\ninvolving 21 educators shows that GPT-3.5 generates the most effective MCQs\nacross several known metrics. Additionally, it shows that there is still some\nreluctance to adopt AI in the educational field.

Inspired by how new\nsoftware is built on existing code, we ask: can new architecture designs be\nstudied using pretrained models? To this end, we present grafting, a simple\napproach for editing pretrained diffusion transformers (DiTs) to materialize\nnew architectures under small compute budgets. Informed by our analysis of\nactivation behavior and attention locality, we construct a testbed based on the\nDiT-XL/2 design to study the impact of grafting on model quality. Using this\ntestbed, we develop a family of hybrid designs via grafting: replacing softmax\nattention with gated convolution, local attention, and linear attention, and\nreplacing MLPs with variable expansion ratio and convolutional variants.\nNotably, many hybrid designs achieve good quality (FID: 2.38-2.64 vs. 2.27 for\nDiT-XL/2) using <2% pretraining compute. We then graft a text-to-image model\n(PixArt-Sigma), achieving a 1.43x speedup with less than a 2% drop in GenEval\nscore. Finally, we present a case study that restructures DiT-XL/2 by\nconverting every pair of sequential transformer blocks into parallel blocks via\ngrafting. This reduces model depth by 2x and yields better quality (FID: 2.77)\nthan other models of comparable depth. Together, we show that new diffusion\nmodel designs can be explored by grafting pretrained DiTs, with edits ranging\nfrom operator replacement to architecture restructuring.

It can be naturally divided into two subtasks: object\ngeneration and layout generation. While recent generative models have\nsignificantly advanced object-level quality and controllability, layout\ngeneration remains challenging due to limited datasets. Existing methods either\noverfit to these datasets or rely on predefined constraints to optimize\nnumerical layout that sacrifice flexibility. As a result, they fail to generate\nscenes that are both open-vocabulary and aligned with fine-grained user\ninstructions. We introduce DirectLayout, a framework that directly generates\nnumerical 3D layouts from text descriptions using generalizable spatial\nreasoning of large language models (LLMs). DirectLayout decomposes the\ngeneration into three stages: producing a Bird's-Eye View (BEV) layout, lifting\nit into 3D space, and refining object placements. To enable explicit spatial\nreasoning and help the model grasp basic principles of object placement, we\nemploy Chain-of-Thought (CoT) Activation based on the 3D-Front dataset.\nAdditionally, we design CoT-Grounded Generative Layout Reward to enhance\ngeneralization and spatial planning. During inference, DirectLayout addresses\nasset-layout mismatches via Iterative Asset-Layout Alignment through in-context\nlearning. Extensive experiments demonstrate that DirectLayout achieves\nimpressive semantic consistency, generalization and physical plausibility."}

This limitation reduces their effectiveness in applications that\nrequire user-friendly interactions driven by vision-language prompts. To bridge\nthis gap, we introduce a novel task of omnimodal referring expression\nsegmentation (ORES). In this task, a model produces a group of masks based on\narbitrary prompts specified by text only or text plus reference visual\nentities. To address this new challenge, we propose a novel framework to \"Refer\nto Any Segmentation Mask Group\" (RAS), which augments segmentation models with\ncomplex multimodal interactions and comprehension via a mask-centric large\nmultimodal model. For training and benchmarking ORES models, we create datasets\nMaskGroups-2M and MaskGroups-HQ to include diverse mask groups specified by\ntext and reference entities. Through extensive evaluation, we demonstrate\nsuperior performance of RAS on our new ORES task, as well as classic referring\nexpression segmentation (RES) and generalized referring expression segmentation\n(GRES) tasks.
