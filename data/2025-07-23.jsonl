However, the\ntheoretical foundations of learning from CoT data remain underdeveloped, and\nexisting approaches -- such as Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT), Reinforcement\nLearning (RL), Tree-of-Thoughts (ToT), and Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) --\noften fail on complex reasoning tasks. In this work, we identify core obstacles\nthat hinder effective CoT learning, including distribution drift, lack of\nembedded search, and exponential inference costs. We introduce the Diligent\nLearner, a new learning paradigm that explicitly models reasoning as a\ndepth-first search guided by a validator and supports backtracking upon\nfailure. Under two mild and realistic assumptions, we prove that the Diligent\nLearner can efficiently learn from CoT data while existing methods fail to do\nso.

As complex\nsystems grow, coherence becomes fragile unless a higher-order structure ensures\nsemantic consistency. This paper introduces the Recursive Coherence Principle\n(RCP): a foundational constraint stating that for any reasoning system of order\nN, composed of systems operating over conceptual spaces of order N-1, semantic\ncoherence is preserved only by a recursively evaluable generalization operator\nthat spans and aligns those lower-order conceptual spaces. Crucially, this\ncoherence enables structural alignment. Without recursive coherence, no system\ncan reliably preserve goals, meanings, or reasoning consistency at scale. We\nformally define the Functional Model of Intelligence (FMI) as the only known\noperator capable of satisfying the RCP at any scale. The FMI is a minimal,\ncomposable architecture with internal functions (evaluation, modeling,\nadaptation, stability, decomposition, bridging) and external functions\n(storage, recall, System 1 and System 2 reasoning) vital for preserving\nsemantic structure across inference and coordination layers. We prove that any\nsystem lacking the FMI will experience recursive coherence breakdown as it\nscales, arguing that common AI issues like misalignment, hallucination, and\ninstability are symptoms of this structural coherence loss. Unlike other\nfoundational principles, RCP uniquely captures the internal, recursive dynamics\nneeded for coherent, alignable intelligence, modeling semantic coherence under\nrecursion. This work significantly impacts AI alignment, advocating a shift\nfrom behavioral constraints to structural coherence, and offers a pathway for\nsafely generalizable, robustly coherent AI at scale."}

The advent of Large Language\nModels (LLMs) represents a fundamental shift, enabling computational systems to\nengage with this previously inaccessible domain using natural language. This\npaper introduces a unified framework to understand and contrast these\nproblem-solving paradigms. We define and delineate the problem spaces\naddressable by formal languages versus natural language. While solutions to the\nformer problem class can be evaluated using binary quality measures, the latter\nrequires a much more nuanced definition of approximate solution space taking\ninto account the vagueness, subjectivity and ambiguity inherent to natural\nlanguage. We therefore introduce a vector-valued trust index Q, which reflects\nsolution quality and distinguishes the binary correctness of formal solutions\nfrom the continuous adequacy spectrum characteristic of natural language\nsolutions. Within this framework, we propose two statistical quality\ndimensions. Normalized bi-semantic entropy measures robustness and conceptual\ndiversity of LLM answers given semantic variation in problem formulations.\nEmotional valence maps subjective valuation of a solution to a quantifiable\nmetric that can be maximized by invoking statistical measures.

However, existing TEE implementations\nare not designed to support the resource-intensive nature of LLMs efficiently.\nIn this work, we first present a comprehensive evaluation of the LLMs within a\nTEE-enabled confidential computing environment, specifically utilizing Intel\nTrust Domain Extensions (TDX). We constructed experiments on three\nenvironments: TEE-based, CPU-only, and CPU-GPU hybrid implementations, and\nevaluated their performance in terms of tokens per second.\n  Our first observation is that distilled models, i.e., DeepSeek, surpass other\nmodels in performance due to their smaller parameters, making them suitable for\nresource-constrained devices. Also, in the quantized models such as 4-bit\nquantization (Q4) and 8-bit quantization (Q8), we observed a performance gain\nof up to 3x compared to FP16 models. Our findings indicate that for fewer\nparameter sets, such as DeepSeek-r1-1.5B, the TDX implementation outperforms\nthe CPU version in executing computations within a secure environment. We\nfurther validate the results using a testbench designed for SoC design tasks.\nThese validations demonstrate the potential of efficiently deploying\nlightweight LLMs on resource-constrained systems for semiconductor CAD\napplications."}

Predicting and managing inventory levels in response to\nthese variations can be challenging, leading to either excess inventory or\nstockouts. Additionally, the coordination among stakeholders at various level\nof food supply chain is not considered in the existing body of literature. To\nbridge these research gaps, this study focuses on inventory management of\nagri-food products under demand and lead time uncertainties. By implementing\neffective inventory replenishment policy results in maximize the overall profit\nthroughout the supply chain. However, the complexity of the problem increases\ndue to these uncertainties and shelf-life of the product, that makes\nchallenging to implement traditional approaches to generate optimal set of\nsolutions. Thus, the current study propose a novel Deep Reinforcement Learning\n(DRL) algorithm that combines the benefits of both value- and policy-based DRL\napproaches for inventory optimization under uncertainties. The proposed\nalgorithm can incentivize collaboration among stakeholders by aligning their\ninterests and objectives through shared optimization goal of maximizing\nprofitability along the agri-food supply chain while considering perishability,\nand uncertainty simultaneously. By selecting optimal order quantities with\ncontinuous action space, the proposed algorithm effectively addresses the\ninventory optimization challenges.

However, optimizing policies with respect to a single\nreward model estimate can render it vulnerable to inaccuracies in the reward\nmodel. We empirically study the variability of reward model training on\nopen-source benchmarks. We observe that independently trained reward models on\nthe same preference dataset can exhibit substantial disagreement, highlighting\nthe instability of current alignment strategies. Employing a theoretical model,\nwe demonstrate that variability in reward model estimation can cause\noverfitting, leading to the risk of performance degradation. To mitigate this\nrisk, we propose a variance-aware policy optimization framework for\npreference-based alignment. The key ingredient of the framework is a new policy\nregularizer that incorporates reward model variance estimates. We show that\nvariance-aware policy optimization provably reduces the risk of outputting a\nworse policy than the default.

Without fine-tuning, PICACO\noptimizes a meta-instruction that navigates multiple values to better elicit\nLLMs' understanding of them and improve their alignment. This is achieved by\nmaximizing the total correlation between specified values and LLM responses,\ntheoretically reinforcing value correlation while reducing distractive noise,\nresulting in effective value instructions. Extensive experiments on five value\nsets show that PICACO works well with both black-box and open-source LLMs,\noutperforms several recent strong baselines, and achieves a better balance\nacross up to 8 distinct values."}
