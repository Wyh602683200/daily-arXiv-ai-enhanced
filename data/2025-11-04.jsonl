However, the proliferation of fake or misleading reviews often\ngenerated by bots, paid agents, or AI models poses a significant threat to\ntrust and transparency within review ecosystems. Existing detection models\nprimarily rely on unimodal, typically textual, data and therefore fail to\ncapture semantic inconsistencies across different modalities. To address this\ngap, a robust multimodal fake review detection framework is proposed,\nintegrating textual features encoded with BERT and visual features extracted\nusing ResNet-50. These representations are fused through a classification head\nto jointly predict review authenticity. To support this approach, a curated\ndataset comprising 21,142 user-uploaded images across food delivery,\nhospitality, and e-commerce domains was utilized. Experimental results indicate\nthat the multimodal model outperforms unimodal baselines, achieving an F1-score\nof 0.934 on the test set. Additionally, the confusion matrix and qualitative\nanalysis highlight the model's ability to detect subtle inconsistencies, such\nas exaggerated textual praise paired with unrelated or low-quality images,\ncommonly found in deceptive content.

Four widely used Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning methods, LoRA,\nIA3, Prompt-Tuning, and P-Tuning, are applied to four instruction-tuned model\nfamilies (Meta-Llama-3-8B, Qwen2.5-7B, Mistral-7B, and Gemma-7B). In total, 235\nfine-tuned variants are evaluated across eleven safety hazard categories and\nnine demographic fairness dimensions. The results show that adapter-based\napproaches (LoRA, IA3) tend to improve safety scores and are the least\ndisruptive to fairness, retaining higher accuracy and lower bias scores. In\ncontrast, prompt-based methods (Prompt-Tuning and P-Tuning) generally reduce\nsafety and cause larger fairness regressions, with decreased accuracy and\nincreased bias. Alignment shifts are strongly moderated by base model type:\nLLaMA remains stable, Qwen records modest gains, Gemma experiences the steepest\nsafety decline, and Mistral, which is released without an internal moderation\nlayer, displays the greatest variance. Improvements in safety do not\nnecessarily translate into improvements in fairness, and no single\nconfiguration optimizes all fairness metrics simultaneously, indicating an\ninherent trade-off between these objectives.

TLP is composed of two connected\nmicroarchitectural perceptron predictors, named First Level Predictor (FLP) and\nSecond Level Predictor (SLP). FLP performs accurate off-chip prediction by\nusing several program features based on virtual addresses and a novel selective\ndelay component. The novelty of SLP relies on leveraging off-chip prediction to\ndrive L1D prefetch filtering by using physical addresses and the FLP prediction\nas features. TLP constitutes the first hardware proposal targeting both\noff-chip prediction and prefetch filtering using a multi-level perceptron\nhardware approach. TLP only requires 7KB of storage. To demonstrate the\nbenefits of TLP we compare its performance with state-of-the-art approaches\nusing off-chip prediction and prefetch filtering on a wide range of single-core\nand multi-core workloads. Our experiments show that TLP reduces the average\nDRAM transactions by 30.7% and 17.7%, as compared to a baseline using\nstate-of-the-art cache prefetchers but no off-chip prediction mechanism, across\nthe single-core and multi-core workloads, respectively, while recent work\nsignificantly increases DRAM transactions.

However, its\nunderlying mechanism remains unclear, and it introduces significant\ncomputational overhead. In this work, we first identify that DoRA's success\nstems from its capacity to increase the singular value entropy of the weight\nupdate matrix, which promotes a more uniform update distribution akin to full\nfine-tuning. We then reformulate DoRA into a mathematically equivalent and more\nefficient matrix form, revealing it as a learnable weight conditioning method.\nBased on this insight, we propose a unified framework for designing advanced\nPEFT methods by exploring two orthogonal dimensions: the architectural\nplacement and the transformation type of the conditioning matrix. Within this\nframework, we introduce two novel methods: (1) \\textbf{Pre-Diag}, which applies\na diagonal conditioning matrix before the LoRA update to efficiently calibrate\nthe pre-trained weights, thereby enhancing performance while reducing training\ntime; and (2) \\textbf{S}kewed \\textbf{O}rthogonal \\textbf{R}otation\n\\textbf{A}daptation (\\textbf{SORA}), which employs a parameter-efficient\northogonal rotation to perform a more powerful, norm-preserving transformation\nof the feature space.

On the other hand, PHY-Teacher is a physics-model-based design\nof action policies that focuses solely on safety-critical functions.\nPHY-Teacher is novel in its real-time patch for two key missions: i) fostering\nthe teaching-to-learn paradigm for DRL-Student and ii) backing up the safety of\nreal plants. The Trigger manages the interaction between the DRL-Student and\nthe PHY-Teacher. Powered by the three interactive components, the Real-DRL can\neffectively address safety challenges that arise from the unknown unknowns and\nthe Sim2Real gap. Additionally, Real-DRL notably features i) assured safety,\nii) automatic hierarchy learning (i.e., safety-first learning and then\nhigh-performance learning), and iii) safety-informed batch sampling to address\nthe learning experience imbalance caused by corner cases. Experiments with a\nreal quadruped robot, a quadruped robot in NVIDIA Isaac Gym, and a cart-pole\nsystem, along with comparisons and ablation studies, demonstrate the Real-DRL's\neffectiveness and unique features."}

As this process is reversible, these\ntransitions also occur in reverse, where intermediate states progressively\nmerge, tracing a path back to the initial distribution. We demonstrate that\nthese transitions can be detected as discontinuities in $n^{\\text{th}}$-order\ncross-fluctuations.

In terms of this observation, we propose an\nEnergy-based Multi-prompt Learning (EMPL) to generate multiple prompt\nembeddings by drawing instances from an energy-based distribution, which is\nimplicitly defined by VLMs. So our EMPL is not only parameter-efficient but\nalso rigorously lead to the balance between in-domain and out-of-domain\nopen-vocabulary generalization. Comprehensive experiments have been conducted\nto justify our claims and the excellence of EMPL."}

The core of BOOM is a likelihood-free alignment\nloss that bootstraps the policy using the planner's non-parametric action\ndistribution, combined with a soft value-weighted mechanism that prioritizes\nhigh-return behaviors and mitigates variability in the planner's action quality\nwithin the replay buffer. Experiments on the high-dimensional DeepMind Control\nSuite and Humanoid-Bench show that BOOM achieves state-of-the-art results in\nboth training stability and final performance.

To the best of our knowledge, this is the first\napplication of an FTT with a GRU for RUL prediction on NASA CMAPSS, enabling\nsimultaneous capture of global and local degradation patterns in a compact\narchitecture. On CMAPSS FD001, FTT-GRU attains RMSE 30.76, MAE 18.97, and\n$R^2=0.45$, with 1.12 ms CPU latency at batch=1. Relative to the best published\ndeep baseline (TCN--Attention), it improves RMSE by 1.16\\% and MAE by 4.00\\%.\nTraining curves averaged over $k=3$ runs show smooth convergence with narrow\n95\\% confidence bands, and ablations (GRU-only, FTT-only) support the\ncontribution of both components. These results demonstrate that a compact\nTransformer-RNN hybrid delivers accurate and efficient RUL predictions on\nCMAPSS, making it suitable for real-time industrial prognostics."}

Model performance was assessed using image quality\nmetrics and Visual Turing Tests, where ophthalmologists ranked generated images\nand evaluated anatomical fidelity. The best model's performance was further\ntested within the manually segmented vitreous on newly acquired data. Results:\nU-Net achieved the highest Peak Signal-to-Noise Ratio (PSNR: 30.230) and\nStructural Similarity Index Measure (SSIM: 0.820), followed by cDDPM. For\nLearned Perceptual Image Patch Similarity (LPIPS), Pix2Pix (0.697) and cDDPM\n(0.753) performed best. In the first Visual Turing Test, cDDPM ranked highest\n(3.07); in the second (best model only), cDDPM achieved a 32.9% fool rate and\n85.7% anatomical preservation. On newly acquired data, cDDPM generated vitreous\nregions more similar in PSNR to the ART100 reference than true ART1 or ART10\nB-scans and achieved higher PSNR on whole images when conditioned on ART1 than\nART10. Conclusions: Results reveal discrepancies between quantitative metrics\nand clinical evaluation, highlighting the need for combined assessment. cDDPM\nshowed strong potential for generating clinically meaningful vitreous OCT\nimages while reducing acquisition time fourfold.

This can lead to subtly inconsistent\nuser experiences, or shifts in behavior that deviate from the original\nalignment of the models. In this paper, we explore how accumulating context by\nengaging in interactions and processing text -- talking and reading -- can\nchange the beliefs of language models, as manifested in their responses and\nbehaviors.Our results reveal that models' belief profiles are highly malleable:\nGPT-5 exhibits a 54.7% shift in its stated beliefs after 10 rounds of\ndiscussion about moral dilemmas and queries about safety, while Grok 4 shows a\n27.2% shift on political issues after reading texts from the opposing position.\nWe also examine models' behavioral changes by designing tasks that require tool\nuse, where each tool selection corresponds to an implicit belief.

Although machine learning (ML) and deep\nlearning (DL) methods have improved tag localization, localizing malicious\njammers within a single room and across changing indoor layouts remains largely\nunexplored. Two novel UWB datasets, collected under original and modified room\nconfigurations, are introduced to establish comprehensive ML/DL baselines.\nPerformance is rigorously evaluated using a variety of classification and\nregression metrics. On the source dataset with the collected UWB features,\nRandom Forest achieves the highest F1-macro score of 0.95 and XGBoost achieves\nthe lowest mean Euclidean error of 20.16 cm. However, deploying these\nsource-trained models in the modified room layout led to severe performance\ndegradation, with XGBoost's mean Euclidean error increasing tenfold to 207.99\ncm, demonstrating significant domain shift. To mitigate this degradation, a\ndomain-adversarial ConvNeXt autoencoder (A-CNT) is proposed that leverages a\ngradient-reversal layer to align CIR-derived features across domains. The A-CNT\nframework restores localization performance by reducing the mean Euclidean\nerror to 34.67 cm. This represents a 77 percent improvement over\nnon-adversarial transfer learning and an 83 percent improvement over the best\nbaseline, restoring the fraction of samples within 30 cm to 0.56.
