To enable a\nuser-friendly traffic signal control plan management process, this study\nproposes Chat2SPaT, a method to convert users' semi-structured and ambiguous\ndescriptions on the signal control plan to exact signal phase and timing (SPaT)\nresults, which could further be transformed into structured stage-based or\nring-based plans to interact with intelligent transportation system (ITS)\nsoftware and traffic signal controllers. With curated prompts, Chat2SPaT first\nleverages large language models' (LLMs) capability of understanding users' plan\ndescriptions and reformulate the plan as a combination of phase sequence and\nphase attribute results in the json format. Based on LLM outputs, python\nscripts are designed to locate phases in a cycle, address nuances of traffic\nsignal control, and finally assemble the complete traffic signal control plan.\nWithin a chat, the pipeline can be utilized iteratively to conduct further plan\nediting. Experiments show that Chat2SPaT can generate plans with an accuracy of\nover 94% for both English and Chinese cases, using a test dataset with over 300\nplan descriptions. As the first benchmark for evaluating LLMs' capability of\nunderstanding traffic signal control plan descriptions, Chat2SPaT provides an\neasy-to-use plan management pipeline for traffic practitioners and researchers,\nserving as a potential new building block for a more accurate and versatile\napplication of LLMs in the field of ITS.

After each\naction, the agent observes the updated GUI environment to plan the next step.\nHowever, two main challenges arise: i) resolving ambiguity in task planning\n(i.e., the action proposal sequence), where selecting an appropriate plan is\nnon-trivial, as many valid ones may exist; ii) accurately grounding actions in\ncomplex and high-resolution interfaces, i.e., precisely interacting with visual\ntargets.\n  This paper investigates the two aforementioned challenges with our GUI\nTest-time Scaling Agent, namely GTA1. First, to select the most appropriate\naction proposal, we introduce a test-time scaling method. At each step, we\nsample multiple candidate action proposals and leverage a judge model to\nevaluate and select the most suitable one. It trades off computation for better\ndecision quality by concurrent sampling, shortening task execution steps, and\nimproving overall performance. Second, we propose a model that achieves\nimproved accuracy when grounding the selected action proposal to its\ncorresponding visual elements. Our key insight is that reinforcement learning\n(RL) facilitates visual grounding through inherent objective alignments,\nrewarding successful clicks on interface elements.\n  Experimentally, our method establishes state-of-the-art performance across\ndiverse benchmarks.

In this work, we show that paired preference data consisting of\nindividually weak data points can enable gains beyond the strength of each\nindividual data point. We formulate the delta learning hypothesis to explain\nthis phenomenon, positing that the relative quality delta between points\nsuffices to drive learning via preference tuning--even when supervised\nfinetuning on the weak data hurts. We validate our hypothesis in controlled\nexperiments and at scale, where we post-train 8B models on preference data\ngenerated by pairing a small 3B model's responses with outputs from an even\nsmaller 1.5B model to create a meaningful delta. Strikingly, on a standard\n11-benchmark evaluation suite (MATH, MMLU, etc.), our simple recipe matches the\nperformance of Tulu 3, a state-of-the-art open model tuned from the same base\nmodel while relying on much stronger supervisors (e.g., GPT-4o).

We\nargue that future research should focus on co-designing robust knowledge\nfoundations, reasoning certification, and attack-resistant interfaces to ensure\nLLMs can effectively counter misinformation across varied domains."}

While existing research has primarily\nconcentrated on methods like data replay, model expansion, or parameter\nregularization, the fundamental role of the learning paradigm within CPT\nremains largely unexplored. This paper presents a comparative analysis of two\ncore post-training paradigms: supervised fine-tuning (SFT) and reinforcement\nfine-tuning (RFT), investigating their respective impacts on knowledge\nretention during CPT. Our experiments are conducted on a benchmark comprising\nseven diverse multimodal tasks, utilizing Qwen2.5-VL-7B-Instruct as the base\nmodel for continual post-training. The investigation yields two significant\nfindings: (1) When continuously learning on downstream tasks, SFT leads to\ncatastrophic forgetting of previously learned tasks. In contrast, RFT\ninherently preserves prior knowledge and achieve performance comparable to\nmulti-task training. (2) RFT successfully protects and even enhances the\nmodel's general knowledge on standard benchmarks (e.g., MMMU and MMLU-Pro).\nConversely, SFT degrades general model capabilities severely. Further analysis\nshows that explicit mechanisms, such as KL penalty and chain-of-thought\nreasoning, are not the primary factors. Instead, we find that the implicit\nregularization inherent to RFT is a key factor in mitigating forgetting.\nFinally, we propose a rollout-based instance filtering algorithm to improve the\nstability and efficiency of RFT.

TuneShield generates synthetic conversation samples,\ntermed 'healing data', based on the identified toxic samples, using them to\nmitigate toxicity while reinforcing desirable behavior during fine-tuning. It\nperforms an alignment process to further nudge the chatbot towards producing\ndesired responses. Our findings show that TuneShield effectively mitigates\ntoxicity injection attacks while preserving conversational quality, even when\nthe toxicity classifiers are imperfect or biased. TuneShield proves to be\nresilient against adaptive adversarial and jailbreak attacks. Additionally,\nTuneShield demonstrates effectiveness in mitigating adaptive toxicity injection\nattacks during dialog-based learning (DBL)."}

A Theory of Long-Range Connections for the Sensorimotor Brain", "categories": ["q-bio.NC", "cs.AI"], "comment": "18 pages, 7 figures", "summary": "In the traditional understanding of the neocortex, sensory information flows\nup a hierarchy of regions, with each level processing increasingly complex\nfeatures. Information also flows down the hierarchy via a different set of\nconnections. Although the hierarchical model has significant support, many\nanatomical connections do not conform to the standard hierarchical\ninterpretation. In addition, hierarchically arranged regions sometimes respond\nin parallel, not sequentially as would occur in a hierarchy. This and other\nevidence suggests that two regions can act in parallel and hierarchically at\nthe same time. Given this flexibility, the word \"heterarchy\" might be a more\nsuitable term to describe neocortical organization. This paper proposes a new\ninterpretation of how sensory and motor information is processed in the\nneocortex. The key to our proposal is what we call the \"Thousand Brains\nTheory\", which posits that every cortical column is a sensorimotor learning\nsystem. Columns learn by integrating sensory input over multiple movements of a\nsensor. In this view, even primary and secondary regions, such as V1 and V2,\ncan learn and recognize complete 3D objects. This suggests that the\nhierarchical connections between regions are used to learn the compositional\nstructure of parent objects composed of smaller child objects. We explain the\ntheory by examining the different types of long-range connections between\ncortical regions and between the neocortex and thalamus. We describe these\nconnections, and then suggest the specific roles they play in the context of a\nheterarchy of sensorimotor regions.

Experiments on three psychological trait\ntheories (Big5, Schwartz, VIA) show that our mediator generation methods and\nsimulation framework effectively identify high-validity items. LLMs demonstrate\nthe ability to generate plausible mediators from trait definitions and to\nsimulate respondent behavior for item validation. Our problem formulation,\nmetrics, methodology, and dataset open a new direction for cost-effective\nsurvey development and a deeper understanding of how LLMs replicate human-like\nbehavior. We will publicly release our dataset and code to support future work."}

Throughout extensive\nexperiments on various robot platforms, we reveal that (1) task diversity\nproves more critical than per-task demonstration quantity, benefiting transfer\nfrom diverse pre-training tasks to novel downstream scenarios; (2)\nmulti-embodiment pre-training data is optional for cross-embodiment\ntransfer-models trained on high-quality single-embodiment data can efficiently\ntransfer to different platforms, showing more desirable scaling property during\nfine-tuning than multi-embodiment pre-trained models; and (3) expert diversity,\narising from individual operational preferences and stochastic variations in\nhuman demonstrations, can be confounding to policy learning, with velocity\nmultimodality emerging as a key contributing factor. Based on this insight, we\npropose a distribution debiasing method to mitigate velocity ambiguity, the\nyielding GO-1-Pro achieves substantial performance gains of 15%, equivalent to\nusing 2.5 times pre-training data. Collectively, these findings provide new\nperspectives and offer practical guidance on how to scale robotic manipulation\ndatasets effectively."}

However, their high\ncomputational demands often hinder practical deployment. Existing studies\nevaluate the efficiency of LLM-based rerankers using proxy metrics such as\nlatency, the number of forward passes, input tokens, and output tokens.\nHowever, these metrics depend on hardware and running-time choices (\\eg\nparallel or not, batch size, etc), and often fail to account for model size,\nmaking it difficult to interpret and obscuring the evaluation of the\nefficiency-effectiveness tradeoff. To address this issue, we propose\nE\\textsuperscript{2}R-FLOPs, for LLM-based rerankers: ranking metrics per\nPetaFLOP (RPP) for relevance per compute and queries per PetaFLOP (QPP) for\nhardware-agnostic throughput. Companied with the new metrics, an interpretable\nFLOPs estimator is built to estimate the FLOPs of an LLM-based reranker even\nwithout running any experiments. Based on the proposed metrics, we conduct\ncomprehensive experiments to evaluate a wide range of LLM-based rerankers with\ndifferent architecture, studying the efficiency-effectiveness trade-off and\nbringing this issue to the attention of the research community."}

While object-centric flow\nprediction methods mitigate this issue, they remain limited to scenarios\ninvolving rigid objects with clear displacement and minimal occlusion. In this\nwork, we present Embodiment-Centric Flow (EC-Flow), a framework that directly\nlearns manipulation from action-unlabeled videos by predicting\nembodiment-centric flow. Our key insight is that incorporating the embodiment's\ninherent kinematics significantly enhances generalization to versatile\nmanipulation scenarios, including deformable object handling, occlusions, and\nnon-object-displacement tasks. To connect the EC-Flow with language\ninstructions and object interactions, we further introduce a goal-alignment\nmodule by jointly optimizing movement consistency and goal-image prediction.\nMoreover, translating EC-Flow to executable robot actions only requires a\nstandard robot URDF (Unified Robot Description Format) file to specify\nkinematic constraints across joints, which makes it easy to use in practice. We\nvalidate EC-Flow on both simulation (Meta-World) and real-world tasks,\ndemonstrating its state-of-the-art performance in occluded object handling (62%\nimprovement), deformable object manipulation (45% improvement), and\nnon-object-displacement tasks (80% improvement) than prior state-of-the-art\nobject-centric flow methods.

We introduce\nAgent KB, a hierarchical experience framework that enables complex agentic\nproblem solving via a novel Reason-Retrieve-Refine pipeline. Agent KB addresses\na core limitation: agents traditionally cannot learn from each other's\nexperiences. By capturing both high-level strategies and detailed execution\nlogs, Agent KB creates a shared knowledge base that enables cross-agent\nknowledge transfer. Evaluated on the GAIA benchmark, Agent KB improves success\nrates by up to 16.28 percentage points. On the most challenging tasks, Claude-3\nimproves from 38.46% to 57.69%, while GPT-4 improves from 53.49% to 73.26% on\nintermediate tasks. On SWE-bench code repair, Agent KB enables Claude-3 to\nimprove from 41.33% to 53.33%. Our results suggest that Agent KB provides a\nmodular, framework-agnostic infrastructure for enabling agents to learn from\npast experiences and generalize successful strategies to new tasks."}
