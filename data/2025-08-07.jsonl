However, their growing openness and\ninteraction complexity pose serious risks, notably jailbreak and adversarial\nattacks. Existing defenses typically rely on external guard modules, such as\ndedicated safety agents, to handle unsafe behaviors. Unfortunately, this\nparadigm faces two challenges: (1) standalone agents offer limited protection,\nand (2) their independence leads to single-point failure-if compromised,\nsystem-wide safety collapses. Naively increasing the number of guard agents\nfurther raises cost and complexity. To address these challenges, we propose\nEvo-MARL, a novel multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) framework that\nenables all task agents to jointly acquire defensive capabilities.

Static benchmarks lack agency,\nwhile interactive benchmarks suffer from a severe modal bottleneck, typically\nignoring crucial auditory and temporal cues. To bridge this evaluation chasm,\nwe introduce OmniPlay, a diagnostic benchmark designed not just to evaluate,\nbut to probe the fusion and reasoning capabilities of agentic models across the\nfull sensory spectrum. Built on a core philosophy of modality interdependence,\nOmniPlay comprises a suite of five game environments that systematically create\nscenarios of both synergy and conflict, forcing agents to perform genuine\ncross-modal reasoning. Our comprehensive evaluation of six leading omni-modal\nmodels reveals a critical dichotomy: they exhibit superhuman performance on\nhigh-fidelity memory tasks but suffer from systemic failures in challenges\nrequiring robust reasoning and strategic planning. We demonstrate that this\nfragility stems from brittle fusion mechanisms, which lead to catastrophic\nperformance degradation under modality conflict and uncover a counter-intuitive\n\"less is more\" paradox, where removing sensory information can paradoxically\nimprove performance. Our findings suggest that the path toward robust AGI\nrequires a research focus beyond scaling to explicitly address synergistic\nfusion.

Despite its\neffectiveness, this study uncovers that LLM empowered recommender systems are\nvulnerable to reconstruction attacks that can expose both system and user\nprivacy. To examine this threat, we present the first systematic study on\ninversion attacks targeting LLM empowered recommender systems, where\nadversaries attempt to reconstruct original prompts that contain personal\npreferences, interaction histories, and demographic attributes by exploiting\nthe output logits of recommendation models. We reproduce the vec2text framework\nand optimize it using our proposed method called Similarity Guided Refinement,\nenabling more accurate reconstruction of textual prompts from model generated\nlogits. Extensive experiments across two domains (movies and books) and two\nrepresentative LLM based recommendation models demonstrate that our method\nachieves high fidelity reconstructions. Specifically, we can recover nearly 65\npercent of the user interacted items and correctly infer age and gender in 87\npercent of the cases. The experiments also reveal that privacy leakage is\nlargely insensitive to the victim model's performance but highly dependent on\ndomain consistency and prompt complexity.

In recent years, Graph Neural Networks\n(GNNs) have emerged as a promising approach, but their training methodologies\nare not yet well-established. It is generally expected that transferring\ntheoretical knowledge from classical algorithms like Minimum Weight Perfect\nMatching (MWPM) to GNNs, a technique known as knowledge distillation, can\neffectively improve performance. In this work, we test this hypothesis by\nrigorously comparing two models based on a Graph Attention Network (GAT)\narchitecture that incorporates temporal information as node features. The first\nis a purely data-driven model (baseline) trained only on ground-truth labels,\nwhile the second incorporates a knowledge distillation loss based on the\ntheoretical error probabilities from MWPM.

Recently, the\nintroduction of DeepSeek R1 has inspired a surge of interest in leveraging\nrule-based rewards as a low-cost alternative for computing advantage functions\nand guiding policy optimization. However, a common challenge observed across\nmany replication and extension efforts is that when multiple sampled responses\nunder a single prompt converge to identical outcomes, whether correct or\nincorrect, the group-based advantage degenerates to zero. This leads to\nvanishing gradients and renders the corresponding samples ineffective for\nlearning, ultimately limiting training efficiency and downstream performance.\nTo address this issue, we propose a consistency-aware policy optimization\nframework that introduces a structured global reward based on outcome\nconsistency, the global loss based on it ensures that, even when model outputs\nshow high intra-group consistency, the training process still receives\nmeaningful learning signals, which encourages the generation of correct and\nself-consistent reasoning paths from a global perspective. Furthermore, we\nincorporate an entropy-based soft blending mechanism that adaptively balances\nlocal advantage estimation with global optimization, enabling dynamic\ntransitions between exploration and convergence throughout training. Our method\nintroduces several key innovations in both reward design and optimization\nstrategy. We validate its effectiveness through substantial performance gains\non multiple mathematical reasoning benchmarks, highlighting the proposed\nframework's robustness and general applicability.

However, this paradigm has significant\nindustrial limitations. Traditional RAG approaches struggle with real-time\nneeds and structured queries that require accessing dynamically generated\ncontent like ticket availability or inventory. Limited to indexing static\npages, search engines cannot perform the interactive queries needed for such\ntime-sensitive data. Academic research has focused on optimizing RAG for static\ncontent, overlooking complex intents and the need for dynamic sources like\ndatabases and real-time APIs. To bridge this gap, we introduce TURA\n(Tool-Augmented Unified Retrieval Agent for AI Search), a novel three-stage\nframework that combines RAG with agentic tool-use to access both static content\nand dynamic, real-time information. TURA has three key components: an\nIntent-Aware Retrieval module to decompose queries and retrieve information\nsources encapsulated as Model Context Protocol (MCP) Servers, a DAG-based Task\nPlanner that models task dependencies as a Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) for\noptimal parallel execution, and a lightweight Distilled Agent Executor for\nefficient tool calling. TURA is the first architecture to systematically bridge\nthe gap between static RAG and dynamic information sources for a world-class AI\nsearch product. Serving tens of millions of users, it leverages an agentic\nframework to deliver robust, real-time answers while meeting the low-latency\ndemands of a large-scale industrial system."}

Recently, generative recommendation\nhas emerged as a promising paradigm, unifying the conventional\nretrieve-and-rank pipeline into an end-to-end model capable of dynamic\ngeneration. However, existing generative methods are fundamentally constrained\nby their unsupervised tokenization, which generates semantic IDs suffering from\ntwo critical flaws: (1) they are semantically flat and uninterpretable, lacking\na coherent hierarchy, and (2) they are prone to representation entanglement\n(i.e., ``ID collisions''), which harms recommendation accuracy and diversity.\nTo overcome these limitations, we propose HiD-VAE, a novel framework that\nlearns hierarchically disentangled item representations through two core\ninnovations. First, HiD-VAE pioneers a hierarchically-supervised quantization\nprocess that aligns discrete codes with multi-level item tags, yielding more\nuniform and disentangled IDs. Crucially, the trained codebooks can predict\nhierarchical tags, providing a traceable and interpretable semantic path for\neach recommendation. Second, to combat representation entanglement, HiD-VAE\nincorporates a novel uniqueness loss that directly penalizes latent space\noverlap. This mechanism not only resolves the critical ID collision problem but\nalso promotes recommendation diversity by ensuring a more comprehensive\nutilization of the item representation space. These high-quality, disentangled\nIDs provide a powerful foundation for downstream generative models. Extensive\nexperiments on three public benchmarks validate HiD-VAE's superior performance\nagainst state-of-the-art methods.
