By leveraging domain-approved\nconnections (e.g., parent-child), predictive models can generate richer medical\nconcept representations by incorporating contextual information from related\nconcepts. However, existing literature primarily focuses on incorporating\ndomain knowledge from a single ontology system, or from multiple ontology\nsystems (e.g., diseases, drugs, and procedures) in isolation, without\nintegrating them into a unified learning structure. Consequently, concept\nrepresentation learning often remains limited to intra-ontology relationships,\noverlooking cross-ontology connections. In this paper, we propose LINKO, a\nlarge language model (LLM)-augmented integrative ontology learning framework\nthat leverages multiple ontology graphs simultaneously by enabling dual-axis\nknowledge propagation both within and across heterogeneous ontology systems to\nenhance medical concept representation learning. Specifically, LINKO first\nemploys LLMs to provide a graph-retrieval-augmented initialization for ontology\nconcept embedding, through an engineered prompt that includes concept\ndescriptions, and is further augmented with ontology context. Second, our\nmethod jointly learns the medical concepts in diverse ontology graphs by\nperforming knowledge propagation in two axes: (1) intra-ontology vertical\npropagation across hierarchical ontology levels and (2) inter-ontology\nhorizontal propagation within every level in parallel. Last, through extensive\nexperiments on two public datasets, we validate the superior performance of\nLINKO over state-of-the-art baselines.

This discrepancy highlights a\ncritical gap between declarative knowledge (knowing about something) and\nprocedural knowledge (knowing how to do something). Although traditional\nreinforcement learning (RL) agents can acquire procedural knowledge through\nenvironmental interaction, they often operate as black boxes and require\nsubstantial training data.

Second, the actions are not\nfull STRIPS either, as they do not reveal all the objects involved in the\nactions effects and preconditions. Previous approaches have addressed different\nversions of this model learning problem, but most assume that actions in the\ntraces are full STRIPS actions or that the domain predicates are all\nobservable.

For formulating and addressing the\nlearning problem, we introduce a variant of STRIPS, which we call STRIPS+,\nwhere certain STRIPS action arguments can be left implicit in preconditions\nwhich can also involve a limited form of existential quantification. The\nlearning problem becomes the problem of learning STRIPS+ models from STRIPS+\nstate-action traces.

The purpose of this study was to experiment\nwith different methods that would be able to assist JPL engineers with directly\npinpointing anomalies and equipment degradation through collected data, and\ncontinue conducting maintenance and operations of the DSN for future space\nmissions around our universe. As such, we have researched various machine\nlearning techniques that can fully reconstruct data through predictive\nanalysis, and determine anomalous data entries within real-time datasets\nthrough statistical computations and thresholds. On top of the fully trained\nand tested machine learning models, we have also integrated the use of a\nreinforcement learning subsystem that classifies identified anomalies based on\nseverity level and a Large Language Model that labels an explanation for each\nanomalous data entry, all of which can be improved and fine-tuned over time\nthrough human feedback/input. Specifically, for the DSN transmitters, we have\nalso implemented a full data pipeline system that connects the data extraction,\nparsing, and processing workflow all together as there was no coherent program\nor script for performing these tasks before. Using this data pipeline system,\nwe were able to then also connect the models trained from DSN antenna data,\ncompleting the data workflow for DSN anomaly detection. This was all wrapped\naround and further connected by an agentic AI system, where complex reasoning\nwas utilized to determine the classifications and predictions of anomalous\ndata."}

Its core argument is that the statistical interpretation of the\nnormal--understood as the average both in the normative and mathematical sense\nof the term--proves useful for understanding the Turing test in at least two\nways. First, in the sense that the Turing test targets normal/average rather\nthan exceptional human intelligence, so that successfully passing the test\nrequires building machines that \"make mistakes\" and display imperfect behavior\njust like normal/average humans. Second, in the sense that the Turing test is a\nstatistical test where judgments of intelligence are never carried out by a\nsingle \"average\" judge (understood as non-expert) but always by a full jury. As\nsuch, the notion of \"average human interrogator\" that Turing talks about in his\noriginal paper should be understood primarily as referring to a mathematical\nabstraction made of the normalized aggregate of individual judgments of\nmultiple judges. In short, this paper argues that the Turing test is a test of\nnormal intelligence as assessed by a normal judge characterizing the average\njudgment of a pool of human interrogators. Its conclusions are twofold. First,\nit argues that large language models such as ChatGPT are unlikely to pass the\nTuring test as those models precisely target exceptional rather than\nnormal/average human intelligence. As such, they constitute models of what it\nproposes to call artificial smartness rather than artificial intelligence per\nse. Second, it argues that the core question of whether the Turing test can\ncontribute anything to the understanding of human cognition is that of whether\nthe human mind is really reducible to the normal/average mind--a question which\nlargely extends beyond the Turing test itself and questions the conceptual\nunderpinnings of the normalist paradigm it belongs to."}

We propose a\nnovel problem formulation, analyze various minimization techniques, and\ninvestigate key factors influencing their effectiveness.

Errors\nclustered in complex scenarios requiring precise trial knowledge or detailed\nclinical adaptation.\n  Discussion: GPT-5 clearly outperformed prior model variants on the radiation\noncology multiple-choice benchmark. Although GPT-5 exhibited favorable\nperformance in generating real-world radiation oncology treatment\nrecommendations, correctness ratings indicate room for further improvement.\nWhile hallucinations were infrequent, the presence of substantive errors\nunderscores that GPT-5-generated recommendations require rigorous expert\noversight before clinical implementation."}

Effectively\nleveraging this data for clinical prediction is challenging, particularly as\nreal-world samples often present with varied or incomplete modalities. Existing\napproaches typically require complete modality data or rely on manual selection\nstrategies, limiting their applicability in real-world clinical settings where\ndata availability varies across patients and institutions. To address these\nlimitations, we propose MoE-Health, a novel Mixture of Experts framework\ndesigned for robust multimodal fusion in healthcare prediction. MoE-Health\narchitecture is specifically developed to handle samples with differing\nmodalities and improve performance on critical clinical tasks. By leveraging\nspecialized expert networks and a dynamic gating mechanism, our approach\ndynamically selects and combines relevant experts based on available data\nmodalities, enabling flexible adaptation to varying data availability\nscenarios. We evaluate MoE-Health on the MIMIC-IV dataset across three critical\nclinical prediction tasks: in-hospital mortality prediction, long length of\nstay, and hospital readmission prediction. Experimental results demonstrate\nthat MoE-Health achieves superior performance compared to existing multimodal\nfusion methods while maintaining robustness across different modality\navailability patterns. The framework effectively integrates multimodal\ninformation, offering improved predictive performance and robustness in\nhandling heterogeneous and incomplete healthcare data, making it particularly\nsuitable for deployment in diverse healthcare environments with heterogeneous\ndata availability."}

Specifically, we propose a Three-Memory framework for Unified\nstructural and logical Anomaly Detection (TMUAD). First, we build a class-level\ntext memory bank for logical anomaly detection by the proposed logic-aware text\nextractor, which can capture rich logical descriptions of objects from input\nimages. Second, we construct an object-level image memory bank that preserves\ncomplete object contours by extracting features from segmented objects. Third,\nwe employ visual encoders to extract patch-level image features for\nconstructing a patch-level memory bank for structural anomaly detection. These\nthree complementary memory banks are used to retrieve and compare normal images\nthat are most similar to the query image, compute anomaly scores at multiple\nlevels, and fuse them into a final anomaly score. By unifying structural and\nlogical anomaly detection through collaborative memory banks, TMUAD achieves\nstate-of-the-art performance across seven publicly available datasets involving\nindustrial and medical domains.

Dynamic watermarking can reveal such tampering, but current schemes\nassume linear-Gaussian dynamics and use constant watermark statistics, making\nthem vulnerable to the time-varying, partly proprietary behavior of MTCs. We\nclose this gap with DynaMark, a reinforcement learning framework that models\ndynamic watermarking as a Markov decision process (MDP). It learns an adaptive\npolicy online that dynamically adapts the covariance of a zero-mean Gaussian\nwatermark using available measurements and detector feedback, without needing\nsystem knowledge. DynaMark maximizes a unique reward function balancing control\nperformance, energy consumption, and detection confidence dynamically. We\ndevelop a Bayesian belief updating mechanism for real-time detection confidence\nin linear systems. This approach, independent of specific system assumptions,\nunderpins the MDP for systems with linear dynamics. On a Siemens Sinumerik 828D\ncontroller digital twin, DynaMark achieves a reduction in watermark energy by\n70% while preserving the nominal trajectory, compared to constant variance\nbaselines. It also maintains an average detection delay equivalent to one\nsampling interval. A physical stepper-motor testbed validates these findings,\nrapidly triggering alarms with less control performance decline and exceeding\nexisting benchmarks."}

Specifically, given an input image, the model\nmust first classify the main visual events (verb classification), then identify\nthe participating entities and their semantic roles (semantic role labeling),\nand finally localize these entities in the image (semantic role localization).\nExisting methods treat verb classification as a single-label problem, but we\nshow through a comprehensive analysis that this formulation fails to address\nthe inherent ambiguity in visual event recognition, as multiple verb categories\nmay reasonably describe the same image. This paper makes three key\ncontributions: First, we reveal through empirical analysis that verb\nclassification is inherently a multi-label problem due to the ubiquitous\nsemantic overlap between verb categories. Second, given the impracticality of\nfully annotating large-scale datasets with multiple labels, we propose to\nreformulate verb classification as a single positive multi-label learning\n(SPMLL) problem - a novel perspective in SR research. Third, we design a\ncomprehensive multi-label evaluation benchmark for SR that is carefully\ndesigned to fairly evaluate model performance in a multi-label setting. To\naddress the challenges of SPMLL, we futher develop the Graph Enhanced Verb\nMultilayer Perceptron (GE-VerbMLP), which combines graph neural networks to\ncapture label correlations and adversarial training to optimize decision\nboundaries.
