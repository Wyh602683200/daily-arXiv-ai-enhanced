This unifies existing post-hoc explainability\nalgorithms in KGC and the explanations they produce. Next, we suggest and\nempirically support improved evaluation protocols using popular metrics like\nMean Reciprocal Rank and Hits@$k$. Finally, we stress the importance of\ninterpretability as the ability of explanations to address queries meaningful\nto end-users.

As a result, ill-timed or overly frequent trust evaluations\ncan reduce utilization rate of constrained resources, negatively affecting\ncollaborative task execution. To address this challenge, this paper proposes an\nautonomous trust orchestration method based on a new concept of semantic\nchain-of-trust.

By leveraging its strengths in\nautonomous perception, task decomposition, and semantic reasoning, we propose\nagentic AI to perceive device states and autonomously perform trust evaluations\nof collaborators based on historical performance data only during device idle\nperiods, thereby enabling efficient utilization of distributed resources. In\naddition, agentic AI performs task-specific trust evaluations on collaborator\nresources by analyzing the alignment between resource capabilities and task\nrequirements. Moreover, by maintaining a trust hypergraph embedded with trust\nsemantics for each device, agentic AI enables hierarchical management of\ncollaborators and identifies collaborators requiring trust evaluation based on\ntrust semantics, thereby achieving a balance between overhead and trust\naccuracy. Furthermore, local trust hypergraphs from multiple devices can be\nchained together to support multi-hop collaboration, enabling efficient\ncoordination in large-scale systems.

To spur the\ndevelopment of agents capable of more robust intrinsic reasoning over long\nhorizons, we introduce TextQuests, a benchmark based on the Infocom suite of\ninteractive fiction games. These text-based adventures, which can take human\nplayers over 30 hours and require hundreds of precise actions to solve, serve\nas an effective proxy for evaluating AI agents on focused, stateful tasks. The\nbenchmark is specifically designed to assess an LLM agent's capacity for\nself-contained problem-solving by precluding the use of external tools, thereby\nfocusing on intrinsic long-context reasoning capabilities in an exploratory\nenvironment characterized by the need for trial-and-error learning and\nsustained problem-solving within a single interactive session. We release\nTextQuests at https://textquests.ai."}

We distinguish between intrinsic and\nextrinsic hallucinations, and define a \\textit{hallucination risk} for models.\nWe derive bounds on this risk using learning-theoretic frameworks (PAC-Bayes\nand Rademacher complexity). We then survey detection strategies for\nhallucinations, such as token-level uncertainty estimation, confidence\ncalibration, and attention alignment checks. On the mitigation side, we discuss\napproaches including retrieval-augmented generation, hallucination-aware\nfine-tuning, logit calibration, and the incorporation of fact-verification\nmodules. We propose a unified detection and mitigation workflow, illustrated\nwith a diagram, to integrate these strategies. Finally, we outline evaluation\nprotocols for hallucination, recommending datasets, metrics, and experimental\nsetups to quantify and reduce hallucinations. Our work lays a theoretical\nfoundation and practical guidelines for addressing the crucial challenge of\nhallucination in LLMs."}

Building upon that foundation, the present study delves deeper into\nthe intrinsic dynamics and functional diversity of this model. By\nsystematically exploring the parameter space and employing a range of\nmathematical analysis tools, we theoretically reveal the system 's core\nproperty of functional duality. Specifically, the model exhibits two distinct\ntrajectory behaviors: one is asymptotically stable, corresponding to a reliable\nsignal propagator; the other is Lyapunov stable, characterized by sustained\nself-excited oscillations, functioning as a signal generator. To enable\neffective monitoring and prediction of system states during simulations, we\nintroduce a novel intermediate-state metric termed on-road energy. Simulation\nresults confirm that transitions between the two functional modes can be\ninduced through parameter adjustments or modifications to the connection\nstructure. Moreover, we show that oscillations can be effectively suppressed by\nintroducing external signals.

Diverging from critical traditions that conflate\narbitrariness with injustice, it posits arbitrariness as a semiotic trait: a\nproperty enabling systems - linguistic, legal, or social - to operate\neffectively while withholding their internal rationale. Building on Ferdinand\nde Saussure's concept of l'arbitraire du signe, the analysis extends this\nprinciple beyond language to demonstrate its cross-domain applicability,\nparticularly in law and social dynamics. The paper introduces the \"Motivation\n-> Constatability -> Contestability\" chain, arguing that motivation functions\nas a crucial interface rendering an act's logic vulnerable to intersubjective\ncontestation. When this chain is broken through mechanisms like\n\"immotivization\" or \"Conflict Lateralization\" (exemplified by \"the blur of the\nwolf drowned in the fish\"), acts produce binding effects without exposing their\nrationale, thus precluding justiciability. This structural opacity, while\nappearing illogical, is a deliberate design protecting authority from\naccountability. Drawing on Shannon's entropy model, the paper formalizes\narbitrariness as A = H(L|M) (conditional entropy). It thereby proposes a modern\ntheory of arbitrariness as a neutral operator central to control as well as\ncare, an overlooked dimension of interpersonal relations. While primarily\ndeveloped through human social systems, this framework also illuminates a new\npathway for analyzing explainability in advanced artificial intelligence\nsystems."}

This work introduces two novel methods for synthetic data\ngeneration in autonomous driving and medical image analysis, namely MObI and\nAnydoorMed, respectively. MObI is a first-of-its-kind framework for Multimodal\nObject Inpainting that leverages a diffusion model to produce realistic and\ncontrollable object inpaintings across perceptual modalities, demonstrated\nsimultaneously for camera and lidar.

To address these issues, we introduce Multimodal\nPlanning with Complex Constraints (MPCC), the first benchmark to systematically\nevaluate MLLMs' ability to handle multimodal constraints in planning.
