Reject-option\nprediction addresses this by allowing the model to abstain when prediction\nuncertainty is high. Traditional reject-option approaches focus solely on\naleatoric uncertainty, an assumption valid only when large training data makes\nthe epistemic uncertainty negligible. However, in many practical scenarios,\nlimited data makes this assumption unrealistic. This paper introduces the\nepistemic reject-option predictor, which abstains in regions of high epistemic\nuncertainty caused by insufficient data. Building on Bayesian learning, we\nredefine the optimal predictor as the one that minimizes expected regret -- the\nperformance gap between the learned model and the Bayes-optimal predictor with\nfull knowledge of the data distribution. The model abstains when the regret for\na given input exceeds a specified rejection cost.

However, their widespread deployment remains limited due to the high\nmemory overhead associated with storing all expert parameters, particularly as\nthe number of experts increases. To address this challenge, prior works have\nexplored expert dropping and merging strategies, yet they often suffer from\nperformance drop at high compression ratios. In this paper, we introduce\nPuzzleMoE, a training-free MoE compression method that achieves both high\naccuracy and efficient inference through two key innovations: First, PuzzleMoE\nperforms sparse expert merging by identifying element-wise weight redundancy\nand specialization. It uses a dual-mask to capture both shared and\nexpert-specific parameters. Second, to avoid the overhead of storing binary\nmasks and signs, PuzzleMoE introduces a bit-packed encoding scheme that reuses\nunderutilized exponent bits, enabling efficient MoE inference on GPUs.\nExtensive experiments demonstrate that PuzzleMoE can compress MoE models by up\nto 50% while maintaining accuracy across various tasks. Specifically, it\noutperforms prior MoE compression methods by up to 16.7% on MMLU at 50%\ncompression ratio, and achieves up to 1.28\\times inference speedup."}

However, their\nability to portray non-prosocial, antagonistic personas remains largely\nunexamined. We hypothesize that the safety alignment of modern LLMs creates a\nfundamental conflict with the task of authentically role-playing morally\nambiguous or villainous characters. To investigate this, we introduce the Moral\nRolePlay benchmark, a new dataset featuring a four-level moral alignment scale\nand a balanced test set for rigorous evaluation. We task state-of-the-art LLMs\nwith role-playing characters from moral paragons to pure villains. Our\nlarge-scale evaluation reveals a consistent, monotonic decline in role-playing\nfidelity as character morality decreases. We find that models struggle most\nwith traits directly antithetical to safety principles, such as ``Deceitful''\nand ``Manipulative'', often substituting nuanced malevolence with superficial\naggression. Furthermore, we demonstrate that general chatbot proficiency is a\npoor predictor of villain role-playing ability, with highly safety-aligned\nmodels performing particularly poorly. Our work provides the first systematic\nevidence of this critical limitation, highlighting a key tension between model\nsafety and creative fidelity. Our benchmark and findings pave the way for\ndeveloping more nuanced, context-aware alignment methods."}

To address these issues, we\npropose a semi-automated generation of SADs from source code by integrating\nreverse engineering (RE) techniques with a Large Language Model (LLM). Our\napproach recovers both static and behavioral architectural views by extracting\na comprehensive component diagram, filtering architecturally significant\nelements (core components) via prompt engineering, and generating state machine\ndiagrams to model component behavior based on underlying code logic with\nfew-shots prompting.

For flexibility, agentic RAG employs\nautonomous, multi-round retrieval and reasoning to resolve queries. Although\nrecent agentic RAG has improved via reinforcement learning, they often incur\nsubstantial token overhead from search and reasoning processes. This trade-off\nprioritizes accuracy over efficiency. To address this issue, this work proposes\nTeaRAG, a token-efficient agentic RAG framework capable of compressing both\nretrieval content and reasoning steps. 1) First, the retrieved content is\ncompressed by augmenting chunk-based semantic retrieval with a graph retrieval\nusing concise triplets. A knowledge association graph is then built from\nsemantic similarity and co-occurrence. Finally, Personalized PageRank is\nleveraged to highlight key knowledge within this graph, reducing the number of\ntokens per retrieval. 2) Besides, to reduce reasoning steps, Iterative\nProcess-aware Direct Preference Optimization (IP-DPO) is proposed.\nSpecifically, our reward function evaluates the knowledge sufficiency by a\nknowledge matching mechanism, while penalizing excessive reasoning steps. This\ndesign can produce high-quality preference-pair datasets, supporting iterative\nDPO to improve reasoning conciseness. Across six datasets, TeaRAG improves the\naverage Exact Match by 4% and 2% while reducing output tokens by 61% and 59% on\nLlama3-8B-Instruct and Qwen2.5-14B-Instruct, respectively.

In this work, we study a more realistic and challenging setting\nwhere the agent is limited to online interaction with the training environment.\nTo capture the intrinsic difficulty of exploration in online RMDPs, we\nintroduce the supremal visitation ratio, a novel quantity that measures the\nmismatch between the training dynamics and the deployment dynamics. We show\nthat if this ratio is unbounded, online learning becomes exponentially hard. We\npropose the first computationally efficient algorithm that achieves sublinear\nregret in online RMDPs with $f$-divergence based transition uncertainties.
