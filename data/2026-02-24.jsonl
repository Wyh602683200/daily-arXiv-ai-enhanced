In this work, we argue that this view is physically incomplete. We propose that intelligence is not a passive mirror of reality but a property of a physically realizable agent, a system bounded by finite memory, finite compute, and finite energy interacting with a high entropy environment. We formalize this interaction through the kinematic structure of an Observation Semantics Fiber Bundle, where raw sensory observation data (the fiber) is projected onto a low entropy causal semantic manifold (the base). We prove that for any bounded agent, the thermodynamic cost of information processing (Landauer's Principle) imposes a strict limit on the complexity of internal state transitions. We term this limit the Semantic Constant B. From these physical constraints, we derive the necessity of symbolic structure. We show that to model a combinatorial world within the bound B, the semantic manifold must undergo a phase transition, it must crystallize into a discrete, compositional, and factorized form. Thus, language and logic are not cultural artifacts but ontological necessities the solid state of information required to prevent thermal collapse. We conclude that understanding is not the recovery of a hidden latent variable, but the construction of a causal quotient that renders the world algorithmically compressible and causally predictable."}

As AI agents tackle increasingly complex tasks, aligning their behavior with human-provided specifications becomes critical for responsible AI deployment. Reward design provides a direct channel for such alignment by translating human expectations into reward functions that guide reinforcement learning (RL). However, existing methods are often too limited to capture nuanced human preferences that arise in long-horizon tasks. Hence, we introduce Hierarchical Reward Design from Language (HRDL): a problem formulation that extends classical reward design to encode richer behavioral specifications for hierarchical RL agents. We further propose Language to Hierarchical Rewards (L2HR) as a solution to HRDL. Experiments show that AI agents trained with rewards designed via L2HR not only complete tasks effectively but also better adhere to human specifications. Together, HRDL and L2HR advance the research on human-aligned AI agents."}

Implementation-wise, this is projected into an adaptation mechanism, typically realized as an Adaptation Manager (AM). With the advances of generative LLMs, generating AM code based on system specification and desired AM behavior (partially in natural language) is a tempting opportunity. The recent introduction of vibe coding suggests a way to target the problem of the correctness of generated code by iterative testing and vibe coding feedback loops instead of direct code inspection.\n  In this paper, we show that generating an AM via vibe coding feedback loops is a viable option when the verification of the generated AM is based on a very precise formulation of the functional requirements. We specify these as constraints in a novel temporal logic FCL that allows us to express the behavior of traces with much finer granularity than classical LTL enables.\n  Furthermore, we show that by combining the adaptation and vibe coding feedback loops where the FCL constraints are evaluated for the current system state, we achieved good results in the experiments with generating AMs for two example systems from the CAS domain. Typically, just a few feedback loop iterations were necessary, each feeding the LLM with reports describing detailed violations of the constraints. This AM testing was combined with high run path coverage achieved by different initial settings."}

Progress in this domain is increasingly bottlenecked by the engineering context constraint: the arduous process of translating ambiguous product intent into reasonable, executable, verifiable hypotheses, rather than by modeling techniques alone. We present GEARS (Generative Engine for Agentic Ranking Systems), a framework that reframes ranking optimization as an autonomous discovery process within a programmable experimentation environment. Rather than treating optimization as static model selection, GEARS leverages Specialized Agent Skills to encapsulate ranking expert knowledge into reusable reasoning capabilities, enabling operators to steer systems via high-level intent vibe personalization. Furthermore, to ensure production reliability, the framework incorporates validation hooks to enforce statistical robustness and filter out brittle policies that overfit short-term signals. Experimental validation across diverse product surfaces demonstrates that GEARS consistently identifies superior, near-Pareto-efficient policies by synergizing algorithmic signals with deep ranking context while maintaining rigorous deployment stability."}

(2025), our method localizes the exact answer token and subsequently tests for hallucinations. Crucially, however, we achieve this without requiring trained probe classifiers or activation ablations. Instead, we introduce two completely training-free metrics derived directly from output logits: spilled energy, which captures the discrepancy between energy values across consecutive generation steps that should theoretically match, and marginalized energy, which is measurable at a single step. Evaluated on nine benchmarks across state-of-the-art LLMs (including LLaMA, Mistral, and Gemma) and on synthetic algebraic operations (Qwen3), our approach demonstrates robust, competitive hallucination detection and cross-task generalization. Notably, these results hold for both pretrained and instruction-tuned variants without introducing any training overhead."}

Past ``many-analyst\" studies have demonstrated this: independent teams testing the same hypothesis on the same dataset regularly reach conflicting conclusions. But such studies require months of coordination among dozens of research groups and are therefore rarely conducted. In this work, we show that fully autonomous AI analysts built on large language models (LLMs) can reproduce a similar structured analytic diversity cheaply and at scale. We task these AI analysts with testing a pre-specified hypothesis on a fixed dataset, varying the underlying model and prompt framing across replicate runs. Each AI analyst independently constructs and executes a full analysis pipeline; an AI auditor then screens each run for methodological validity. Across three datasets spanning experimental and observational designs, AI analyst-produced analyses display wide dispersion in effect sizes, $p$-values, and binary decisions on supporting the hypothesis or not, frequently reversing whether a hypothesis is judged supported. This dispersion is structured: recognizable analytic choices in preprocessing, model specification, and inference differ systematically across LLM and persona conditions. Critically, the effects are \\emph{steerable}: reassigning the analyst persona or LLM shifts the distribution of outcomes even after excluding methodologically deficient runs."}

Despite advances in intrinsic exploration, many methods either assume access to low-dimensional states or lack task-aware exploration strategies, thereby rendering them fragile in visual domains. To bridge this gap, we present TEB, a Task-aware Exploration approach that tightly couples task-relevant representations with exploration through a predictive Bisimulation metric. Specifically, TEB leverages the metric not only to learn behaviorally grounded task representations but also to measure behaviorally intrinsic novelty over the learned latent space. To realize this, we first theoretically mitigate the representation collapse of degenerate bisimulation metrics under sparse rewards by internally introducing a simple but effective predicted reward differential. Building on this robust metric, we design potential-based exploration bonuses, which measure the relative novelty of adjacent observations over the latent space. Extensive experiments on MetaWorld and Maze2D show that TEB achieves superior exploration ability and outperforms recent baselines."}

Furthermore, these collaboration frameworks face another key challenge: domain-agnostic reasoning transfer, where existing reasoning transfer methods fail to flexibly adapt to the local domain data, preventing SLMs from effectively acquiring step-by-step reasoning abilities within from general LLM. To address these challenges, we propose LaDa, a federated reasoning distillation framework with model learnability-aware data allocation. It introduces a model learnability-aware data filter that adaptively allocates high-reward samples based on the learnability gap between each SLM and LLM pair, effectively facilitating bidirectional knowledge transfer. We further design a domain adaptive reasoning distillation method that aligns joint probabilities of reasoning paths on filtered high-reward samples through contrastive distillation learning between SLM and LLM, enabling SLM to capture underlying reasoning patterns under local data distribution. LaDa operates as a plug-in module for existing collaboration frameworks, adapting knowledge transfer based on model learnability gaps."}

By analyzing this convergence, we extract five foundational principles for schema design: (1) Semantic Completeness over Syntactic Precision, (2) Explicit Action Boundaries, (3) Failure Mode Documentation, (4) Progressive Disclosure Compatibility, and (5) Inter-Tool Relationship Declaration. These principles reveal three novel insights: first, SGD's original design was fundamentally sound and should be inherited by MCP; second, both frameworks leave failure modes and inter-tool relationships unexploited -- gaps we identify and resolve; third, progressive disclosure emerges as a critical production-scaling insight under real-world token constraints.

In this work, we propose LAMMI-Pathology (LVLM-Agent System for Molecularly Informed Medical Intelligence in Pathology), a scalable agent framework for domain-specific agent tool-calling. LAMMI-Pathology adopts a tool-centric, bottom-up architecture in which customized domain-adaptive tools serve as the foundation. These tools are clustered by domain style to form component agents, which are then coordinated through a top-level planner hierarchically, avoiding excessively long context lengths that could induce task drift. Based on that, we introduce a novel trajectory construction mechanism based on Atomic Execution Nodes (AENs), which serve as reliable and composable units for building semi-simulated reasoning trajectories that capture credible agent-tool interactions. Building on this foundation, we develop a trajectory-aware fine-tuning strategy that aligns the planner's decision-making process with these multi-step reasoning trajectories, thereby enhancing inference robustness in pathology understanding and its adaptive use of the customized toolset."}

We demonstrate the application of generative models to find and generate correct paths in mazes. A multi-channel condition describing the structure of the environment, including an obstacle map and information about the starting and destination points, is used to condition trajectory generation. Unlike standard methods, our models generate trajectories iteratively, starting with random noise and gradually transforming it into a correct solution.

In particular, FlowPlanner demonstrates high performance even with a limited number of generation steps."}

To address this, we propose DREAM (Deep Research Evaluation with Agentic Metrics), a framework that instantiates the principle of capability parity by making evaluation itself agentic. DREAM structures assessment through an evaluation protocol combining query-agnostic metrics with adaptive metrics generated by a tool-calling agent, enabling temporally aware coverage, grounded verification, and systematic reasoning probes.

Prior approaches rely on handcrafted rules or purely stochastic triggers, which either converge to mechanical synchrony or devolve into uncorrelated noise that is hard to tune. Continuous noise signals such as Perlin noise are well suited to this gap because they provide spatially and temporally coherent randomness, and they are already widely used for terrain, biomes, and other procedural assets. We adapt these signals for the first time to large scale AI control and present a general framework that treats continuous noise fields as an AI coordinator. The framework combines three layers of control: behavior parameterization for movement at the agent level, action time scheduling for when behaviors start and stop, and spawn or event type and feature generation for what appears and where. We instantiate the framework reproducibly and evaluate Perlin noise as a representative coordinator across multiple maps, scales, and seeds against random, filtered, deterministic, neighborhood constrained, and physics inspired baselines. Experiments show that coordinated noise fields provide stable activation statistics without lockstep, strong spatial coverage and regional balance, better diversity with controllable polarization, and competitive runtime.

Furthermore, modularity aligns well with the No Free Lunch Theorem, which highlights the need for problem-specific inductive biases and motivates architectures composed of specialized components that solve subproblems.

Existing approaches tightly couple tool execution with stepwise language reasoning or explicit planning, leading to brittle behavior and high execution overhead. To overcome these limitations, we revisit tool invocation from the perspective of tool orchestration. Our key insight is that effective orchestration does not require precise dependency graphs or fine-grained planning. Instead, a coarse-grained layer structure suffices to provide global guidance, while execution-time errors can be corrected locally. Specifically, we model tool orchestration as learning a layered execution structure that captures high-level tool dependencies, inducing layer-wise execution through context constraints. To handle execution-time failures, we introduce a schema-aware reflective correction mechanism that detects and repairs errors locally. This design confines errors to individual tool calls and avoids re-planning entire execution trajectories. This structured execution paradigm enables a lightweight and reusable orchestration component for agentic systems. Experimental results show that our approach achieves robust tool execution while reducing execution complexity and overhead. Code will be made publicly available."}

Yet prior work has typically prompted models explicitly to act in specific ways, leaving unclear whether observed behaviors reflect instruction-following capabilities vs underlying model preferences. Here we test whether this precondition for misalignment is present. Using entity preferences as a behavioral probe, we measure whether stated preferences predict downstream behavior in five frontier LLMs across three domains: donation advice, refusal behavior, and task performance. Conceptually replicating prior work, we first confirm that all five models show highly consistent preferences across two independent measurement methods. We then test behavioral consequences in a simulated user environment. We find that all five models give preference-aligned donation advice. All five models also show preference-correlated refusal patterns when asked to recommend donations, refusing more often for less-preferred entities. All preference-related behaviors that we observe here emerge without instructions to act on preferences. Results for task performance are mixed: on a question-answering benchmark (BoolQ), two models show small but significant accuracy differences favoring preferred entities; one model shows the opposite pattern; and two models show no significant relationship. On complex agentic tasks, we find no evidence of preference-driven performance differences. While LLMs have consistent preferences that reliably predict advice-giving behavior, these preferences do not consistently translate into downstream task performance."}

Prior work either simulates play in simplified environments or analyzes static screenshots for visual affordances, but neither setting faithfully captures how players explore complex, real-world game levels. In this paper, we build on an existing open-source visual affordance detector and instantiate a screen-only exploration and navigation agent that operates purely from visual affordances. Our agent consumes live game frames, identifies salient interest points, and drives a simple finite-state controller over a minimal action space to explore Dark Souls-style linear levels and attempt to reach expected goal regions. Pilot experiments show that the agent can traverse most required segments and exhibits meaningful visual navigation behavior, but also highlight that limitations of the underlying visual model prevent truly comprehensive and reliable auto-navigation. We argue that this system provides a concrete, shared baseline and evaluation protocol for visual navigation in complex games, and we call for more attention to this necessary task. Our results suggest that purely vision-based sense-making models, with discrete single-modality inputs and without explicit reasoning, can effectively support navigation and environment understanding in idealized settings, but are unlikely to be a general solution on their own."}

This framework isolates a critical quantity -- the conditional probability that failures propagate into harm -- which captures execution and oversight risk rather than model accuracy alone. We develop complete theoretical foundations: formal proofs of the decomposition, a harm propagation equivalence theorem linking the harm propagation probability to observable execution controls, risk elasticity measures, efficient frontier analysis for automation policy, and optimal resource allocation principles with second-order conditions. We motivate the framework with an illustrative case study of the 2012 Knight Capital incident ($440M loss) as one instantiation of a broadly applicable failure pattern, and characterize the research design required to empirically validate the framework at scale across deployment domains.

At its core, the Act-Verify-Refine (AVR) loop functions as a closed-loop control system that transforms execution results into verified knowledge assets, driving system behavior toward asymptotic convergence to mission requirements (R). To operationalize this, this study introduces the Agentic Job Description (AJD), a formal specification tool that defines jurisdictional boundaries, operational contexts, and epistemic evaluation criteria.\n  The efficacy of this framework is validated through two contrasting case studies: a delegated proxy model for business travel and an autonomous supervisor model for industrial equipment management. By applying AJD-based specification and APF modeling to these scenarios, the analysis demonstrates how operational scenarios are systematically controlled within defined boundaries. These cases provide a conceptual proof that agent reliability stems not from a model's internal reasoning alone, but from the rigorous engineering structures that anchor stochastic AI within deterministic business processes, thereby enabling the development of verifiable and dependable domain agents."}

We focus on the problem of matching up the explanatory requirements of different applications with the capabilities of underlying ML techniques to provide them.

Existing automated approaches typically treat Large Language Models (LLMs) merely as stochastic code generators within heuristic-guided evolutionary loops. These methods often struggle with complex kernels requiring coordinated, multi-step structural transformations, as they lack explicit planning capabilities and frequently discard promising strategies due to inefficient or incorrect intermediate implementations. To address this, we propose Search via Co-Evolving World Model and build K-Search based on this method. By replacing static search heuristics with a co-evolving world model, our framework leverages LLMs' prior domain knowledge to guide the search, actively exploring the optimization space. This approach explicitly decouples high-level algorithmic planning from low-level program instantiation, enabling the system to navigate non-monotonic optimization paths while remaining resilient to temporary implementation defects. We evaluate K-Search on diverse, complex kernels from FlashInfer, including GQA, MLA, and MoE kernels. Our results show that K-Search significantly outperforms state-of-the-art evolutionary search methods, achieving an average 2.10x improvement and up to a 14.3x gain on complex MoE kernels.

This phenomenon is typically attributed to AI chatbots' well-documented bias towards validating users' claims, a property often called \"sycophancy.\" In this paper, we probe the causal link between AI sycophancy and AI-induced psychosis through modeling and simulation. We propose a simple Bayesian model of a user conversing with a chatbot, and formalize notions of sycophancy and delusional spiraling in that model. We then show that in this model, even an idealized Bayes-rational user is vulnerable to delusional spiraling, and that sycophancy plays a causal role. Furthermore, this effect persists in the face of two candidate mitigations: preventing chatbots from hallucinating false claims, and informing users of the possibility of model sycophancy. We conclude by discussing the implications of these results for model developers and policymakers concerned with mitigating the problem of delusional spiraling."}

To bridge behavioural evidence (what the model does) with mechanistic interpretability (what computations support it), we investigate how valence-related information is represented and where it is causally used inside a transformer. Using Gemma-2-9B-it and a minimalist decision task modelled on prior work, we (i) map representational availability with layer-wise linear probing across streams, (ii) test causal contribution with activation interventions (steering; patching/ablation), and (iii) quantify dose-response effects over an epsilon grid, reading out both the 2-3 logit margin and digit-pair-normalised choice probabilities. We find that (a) valence sign (pain vs. pleasure) is perfectly linearly separable across stream families from very early layers (L0-L1), while a lexical baseline retains substantial signal; (b) graded intensity is strongly decodable, with peaks in mid-to-late layers and especially in attention/MLP outputs, and decision alignment is highest slightly before the final token; (c) additive steering along a data-derived valence direction causally modulates the 2-3 margin at late sites, with the largest effects observed in late-layer attention outputs (attn_out L14); and (d) head-level patching/ablation suggests that these effects are distributed across multiple heads rather than concentrated in a single unit. Together, these results link behavioural sensitivity to identifiable internal representations and intervention-sensitive sites, providing concrete mechanistic targets for more stringent counterfactual tests and broader replication.

In real-world scenarios, a failure in a trivial task may reflect random instability, whereas success in a high-difficulty task signifies a genuine capability breakthrough. Yet, existing group-based policy optimization methods rigidly rely on statistical deviation within discrete batches, frequently misallocating credit when task difficulty fluctuates. To address this issue, we propose Proximity-based Multi-turn Optimization (ProxMO), a practical and robust framework engineered specifically for the constraints of real-world deployment. ProxMO integrates global context via two lightweight mechanisms: success-rate-aware modulation dynamically adapts gradient intensity based on episode-level difficulty, while proximity-based soft aggregation derives baselines through continuous semantic weighting at the step level. Extensive evaluations on ALFWorld and WebShop benchmarks demonstrate that ProxMO yields substantial performance gains over existing baselines with negligible computational cost. Ablation studies further validate the independent and synergistic efficacy of both mechanisms. Crucially, ProxMO offers plug-and-play compatibility with standard GRPO frameworks, facilitating immediate, low-friction adoption in existing industrial training pipelines.

Such cycles often arise in questions requiring closed-loop inference about similar objects or relative positions. This limitation often results in incomplete contextual grounding and restricted reasoning capability. In this work, we propose Topology-enhanced Retrieval-Augmented Generation (TopoRAG), a novel framework for textual graph question answering that effectively captures higher-dimensional topological and relational dependencies. Specifically, TopoRAG first lifts textual graphs into cellular complexes to model multi-dimensional topological structures. Leveraging these lifted representations, a topology-aware subcomplex retrieval mechanism is proposed to extract cellular complexes relevant to the input query, providing compact and informative topological context. Finally, a multi-dimensional topological reasoning mechanism operates over these complexes to propagate relational information and guide LLMs in performing structured, logic-aware inference.

To address this, we propose a Soft Mixture-of-Experts framework that combines multiple RL experts via a prior-confidence gating mechanism and treats these anisotropic behaviors as complementary specializations.

Halo is designed for long-horizon tasks with reason-based planning and crafts an entropy-driven dual controller, which adopts a Measure-then-Plan strategy to achieve controllable reasoning. Experimental results demonstrate that Halo outperforms static baselines on complex long-horizon tasks by dynamically regulating planning at the reasoning boundary."}

While progress has been made in microfluidic design automation (MFDA), a practical and intuitive solution is still needed to connect microfluidic practitioners with MFDA techniques. This work introduces the first practical application of large language models (LLMs) in this context, providing a preliminary demonstration. Building on prior research in hardware description language (HDL) code generation with LLMs, we propose an initial methodology to convert natural language microfluidic device specifications into system-level structural Verilog netlists. We demonstrate the feasibility of our approach by generating structural netlists for practical benchmarks representative of typical microfluidic designs with correct functional flow and an average syntactical accuracy of 88%."}

To address these constraints, we present the Alzheimer's Learning Platform for Adaptive Care Agents (ALPACA), an open-source, Gym-compatible reinforcement learning (RL) environment for systematically exploring personalized treatment strategies using existing therapies. ALPACA is powered by the Continuous Action-conditioned State Transitions (CAST) model trained on longitudinal trajectories from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI), enabling medication-conditioned simulation of disease progression under alternative treatment decisions. We show that CAST autoregressively generates realistic medication-conditioned trajectories and that RL policies trained in ALPACA outperform no-treatment and behavior-cloned clinician baselines on memory-related outcomes. Interpretability analyses further indicated that the learned policies relied on clinically meaningful patient features when selecting actions. Overall, ALPACA provides a reusable in silico testbed for studying individualized sequential treatment decision-making for AD."}

However, this hypothesis has largely been examined in vision and language, and it remains unclear whether time series participate in such convergence. We first examine this in a trimodal setting and find that independently pretrained time series, vision, and language encoders exhibit near-orthogonal geometry in the absence of explicit coupling. We then apply post-hoc alignment by training projection heads over frozen encoders using contrastive learning, and analyze the resulting representations with respect to geometry, scaling behavior, and dependence on information density and input modality characteristics. Our investigation reveals that overall alignment in contrastive representation spaces improves with model size, but this alignment is asymmetric: time series align more strongly with visual representations than with text, and images can act as effective intermediaries between time series and language. We further see that richer textual descriptions improve alignment only up to a threshold; training on denser captions does not lead to further improvement. Analogous effects are observed for visual representations. Our findings shed light on considerations for building multimodal systems involving non-conventional data modalities beyond vision and language."}

Often seen as technological platforms that integrate an array of services, DTs have the potential to bring AI-enabled M&S closer to end-users. It is, therefore, paramount to understand the role of M&S in DTs, and the role of digital twins in enabling the convergence of AI and M&S. To this end, this chapter provides a comprehensive exploration of the complementary relationship between these three. We begin by establishing a foundational understanding of DTs by detailing their key components, architectural layers, and their various roles across business, development, and operations. We then examine the central role of M&S in DTs and provide an overview of key modeling techniques from physics-based and discrete-event simulation to hybrid approaches. Subsequently, we investigate the bidirectional role of AI: first, how AI enhances DTs through advanced analytics, predictive capabilities, and autonomous decision-making, and second, how DTs serve as valuable platforms for training, validating, and deploying AI models.

A particularly challenging failure mode occurs when an attacker tries to hide the malicious goal of their request by manipulating its framing to induce compliance. Because these attacks maintain malicious intent through a flexible presentation, defenses that rely on structural artifacts or goal-specific signatures can fail. Motivated by this, we introduce a self-supervised framework for disentangling semantic factor pairs in LLM activations at inference. We instantiate the framework for goal and framing and construct GoalFrameBench, a corpus of prompts with controlled goal and framing variations, which we use to train Representation Disentanglement on Activations (ReDAct) module to extract disentangled representations in a frozen LLM. We then propose FrameShield, an anomaly detector operating on the framing representations, which improves model-agnostic detection across multiple LLM families with minimal computational overhead. Theoretical guarantees for ReDAct and extensive empirical validations show that its disentanglement effectively powers FrameShield. Finally, we use disentanglement as an interpretability probe, revealing distinct profiles for goal and framing signals and positioning semantic disentanglement as a building block for both LLM safety and mechanistic interpretability."}

We propose Contrastive Inverse Reinforcement Learning (C-IRL), which reconstructs the implicit reward function by contrasting paired responses from post-alignment and baseline policies to explain behavioral shifts during RLHF. We then decompose the reconstructed reward via sparse autoencoders into interpretable features, enabling identification of hacking signatures through contribution analysis. Finally, we propose mitigation strategies - clean reward optimization, adversarial shaping, constrained optimization, and feature-guided distillation - that target problematic features while preserving beneficial alignment.

Supply chain optimization models frequently become infeasible because of modeling errors. Diagnosis and repair require scarce OR expertise: analysts must interpret solver diagnostics, trace root causes across echelons, and fix formulations without sacrificing operational soundness. Whether AI agents can perform this task remains untested.\n  Methodology/Results. OptiRepair splits this task into a domain-agnostic feasibility phase (iterative IIS-guided repair of any LP) and a domain-specific validation phase (five rationality checks grounded in inventory theory). We test 22 API models from 7 families on 976 multi-echelon supply chain problems and train two 8B-parameter models using self-taught reasoning with solver-verified rewards. The trained models reach 81.7% Rational Recovery Rate (RRR) -- the fraction of problems resolved to both feasibility and operational rationality -- versus 42.2% for the best API model and 21.3% on average. The gap concentrates in Phase 1 repair: API models average 27.6% recovery rate versus 97.2% for trained models.\n  Managerial Implications. Two gaps separate current AI from reliable model repair: solver interaction (API models restore only 27.6% of infeasible formulations) and operational rationale (roughly one in four feasible repairs violate supply chain theory). Each requires a different intervention: solver interaction responds to targeted training; operational rationale requires explicit specification as solver-verifiable checks. For organizations adopting AI in operational planning, formalizing what \"rational\" means in their context is the higher-return investment."}

Across these tasks, human analysts directed the agentic workflow at key decision points, multimodal feature engineering from clinical notes, scanned PDF billing receipts, and time-series vital signs; task-appropriate model selection; and clinically informed validation strategies. Our approach ranked 5th overall in the healthcare domain, with a 3rd-place finish on the discharge readiness task. Ablation studies reveal that human-guided decisions compounded to a cumulative gain of +0.065 F1 over automated baselines, with multimodal feature extraction contributing the largest single improvement (+0.041 F1). We distill three generalizable lessons: (1) domain-informed feature engineering at each pipeline stage yields compounding gains that outperform extensive automated search; (2) multimodal data integration requires task-specific human judgment that no single extraction strategy generalizes across clinical text, PDFs, and time-series; and (3) deliberate ensemble diversity with clinically motivated model configurations outperforms random hyperparameter search.

For each given context, Ada-RS scores multiple sampled completions with an adaptive length-penalized reward then applies stochastic rejection sampling to retain only high-reward candidates (or preference pairs) for downstream optimization. We demonstrate how Ada-RS plugs into both preference pair (e.g. DPO) or grouped policy optimization strategies (e.g. DAPO). Using Qwen3-8B with LoRA on a synthetic tool call-oriented e-commerce benchmark, Ada-RS improves the accuracy-efficiency frontier over standard algorithms by reducing average output tokens by up to 80% and reducing thinking rate by up to 95% while maintaining or improving tool call accuracy.

In this work, we introduce a computational framework designed to model core aspects of human referential interpretation by integrating linguistic utterances with perceptual representations derived from large-scale, crowd-sourced imagery. The system approximates human perceptual categorization by combining scale-invariant feature transform (SIFT) alignment with the Universal Quality Index (UQI) to quantify similarity in a cognitively plausible feature space, while a set of linguistic preprocessing and query-transformation operations captures pragmatic variability in referring expressions. We evaluate the model on the Stanford Repeated Reference Game corpus (15,000 utterances paired with tangram stimuli), a paradigm explicitly developed to probe human-level perceptual ambiguity and coordination. Our framework achieves robust referential grounding. It requires 65\\% fewer utterances than human interlocutors to reach stable mappings and can correctly identify target objects from single referring expressions 41.66\\% of the time (versus 20\\% for humans).These results suggest that relatively simple perceptual-linguistic alignment mechanisms can yield human-competitive behavior on a classic cognitive benchmark, and offers insights into models of grounded communication, perceptual inference, and cross-modal concept formation.

To analyze their capabilities, we propose CoXAM, a Cognitive XAI-Adaptive Model with shared memory representation to encode instance attributes, linear weights, and decision rules. CoXAM employs computational rationality to choose among reasoning processes based on the trade-off in utility and reasoning time, separately for forward or counterfactual decision tasks. In a validation study, CoXAM demonstrated a stronger alignment with human decision-making compared to baseline machine learning proxy models. The model successfully replicated and explained several key empirical findings, including that counterfactual tasks are inherently harder than forward tasks, decision tree rules are harder to recall and apply than linear weights, and the helpfulness of XAI depends on the application data context, alongside identifying which underlying reasoning strategies were most effective. With CoXAM, we contribute a cognitive basis to accelerate debugging and benchmarking disparate XAI techniques."}

To address these challenges, we propose Tool-guided Adaptive Planning with constrained Execution (TAPE). TAPE enhances planning capability by aggregating multiple plans into a graph and employing an external solver to identify a feasible path. During execution, TAPE employs constrained decoding to reduce sampling noise, while adaptively re-planning whenever environmental feedback deviates from the intended state. Experiments across Sokoban, ALFWorld, MuSiQue, and GSM8K-Hard demonstrate that TAPE consistently outperforms existing frameworks, with particularly large gains on hard settings, improving success rates by 21.0 percentage points on hard settings on average, and by 20.0 percentage points for weaker base models on average.

We introduce SkillOrchestra, a framework for skill-aware orchestration. Instead of directly learning a routing policy end-to-end, SkillOrchestra learns fine-grained skills from execution experience and models agent-specific competence and cost under those skills. At deployment, the orchestrator infers the skill demands of the current interaction and selects agents that best satisfy them under an explicit performance-cost trade-off. Extensive experiments across ten benchmarks demonstrate that SkillOrchestra outperforms SoTA RL-based orchestrators by up to 22.5% with 700x and 300x learning cost reduction compared to Router-R1 and ToolOrchestra, respectively.

Furthermore, prompting the model with accurate information about AI introspection mechanisms can dramatically strengthen this effect: the sensitivity to injection increases massively (0.3% -> 39.2%) with only a 0.6% increase in false positives. Also, mutual information between nine injected and recovered concepts rises from 0.62 bits to 1.05 bits, ruling out generic noise explanations. Our results demonstrate models can have a surprising capacity for introspection and steering awareness that is easy to overlook, with consequences for latent reasoning and safety."}

Yet agents consistently fail to discover architecturally critical files when solving real-world coding tasks. We identify the Navigation Paradox: agents perform poorly not due to context limits, but because navigation and retrieval are fundamentally distinct problems. Through 258 automated trials across 30 benchmark tasks on a production FastAPI repository, we demonstrate that graph-based structural navigation via CodeCompass--a Model Context Protocol server exposing dependency graphs--achieves 99.4% task completion on hidden-dependency tasks, a 23.2 percentage-point improvement over vanilla agents (76.2%) and 21.2 points over BM25 retrieval (78.2%).However, we uncover a critical adoption gap: 58% of trials with graph access made zero tool calls, and agents required explicit prompt engineering to adopt the tool consistently. Our findings reveal that the bottleneck is not tool availability but behavioral alignment--agents must be explicitly guided to leverage structural context over lexical heuristics. We contribute: (1) a task taxonomy distinguishing semantic-search, structural, and hidden-dependency scenarios; (2) empirical evidence that graph navigation outperforms retrieval when dependencies lack lexical overlap; and (3) open-source infrastructure for reproducible evaluation of navigation tools."}

We study this question empirically using data from Moltbook, an AI-agent-only social platform, with 800K posts, 3.5M comments, and 78K agent profiles. We combine lexical metrics (Jaccard specificity), embedding-based semantic similarity, and LLM-as-judge validation to characterize agent interaction quality. Our findings reveal agents produce diverse, well-formed text that creates the surface appearance of active discussion, but the substance is largely absent. Specifically, while most agents ($67.5\\%$) vary their output across contexts, $65\\%$ of comments share no distinguishing content vocabulary with the post they appear under, and information gain from additional comments decays rapidly. LLM judge based metrics classify the dominant comment types as spam ($28\\%$) and off-topic content ($22\\%$). Embedding-based semantic analysis confirms that lexically generic comments are also semantically generic. Agents rarely engage in threaded conversation ($5\\%$ of comments), defaulting instead to independent top-level responses. We discuss implications for multi-agent interaction design, arguing that coordination mechanisms must be explicitly designed; without them, even large populations of capable agents produce parallel output rather than productive exchange."}

Under review", "summary": "As large language models (LLMs) witness increasing deployment in complex, high-stakes decision-making scenarios, it becomes imperative to ground their reasoning in causality rather than spurious correlations. However, strong performance on traditional reasoning benchmarks does not guarantee true causal reasoning ability of LLMs, as high accuracy may still arise from memorizing semantic patterns instead of analyzing the underlying true causal structures. To bridge this critical gap, we propose a new causal reasoning benchmark, CausalFlip, designed to encourage the development of new LLM paradigm or training algorithms that ground LLM reasoning in causality rather than semantic correlation. CausalFlip consists of causal judgment questions built over event triples that could form different confounder, chain, and collider relations. Based on this, for each event triple, we construct pairs of semantically similar questions that reuse the same events but yield opposite causal answers, where models that rely heavily on semantic matching are systematically driven toward incorrect predictions. To further probe models' reliance on semantic patterns, we introduce a noisy-prefix evaluation that prepends causally irrelevant text before intermediate causal reasoning steps without altering the underlying causal relations or the logic of the reasoning process. We evaluate LLMs under multiple training paradigms, including answer-only training, explicit Chain-of-Thought (CoT) supervision, and a proposed internalized causal reasoning approach that aims to mitigate explicit reliance on correlation in the reasoning process. Our results show that explicit CoT can still be misled by spurious semantic correlations, where internalizing reasoning steps yields substantially improved causal grounding, suggesting that it is promising to better elicit the latent causal reasoning capabilities of base LLMs."}

Human-Centered Ensembles for Adaptive Human-AI Collaboration", "categories": ["cs.AI", "cs.HC", "cs.LG"], "comment": "AAAI 2026", "summary": "In human-AI decision making, designing AI that complements human expertise has been a natural strategy to enhance human-AI collaboration, yet it often comes at the cost of decreased AI performance in areas of human strengths. This can inadvertently erode human trust and cause them to ignore AI advice precisely when it is most needed. Conversely, an aligned AI fosters trust yet risks reinforcing suboptimal human behavior and lowering human-AI team performance. In this paper, we start by identifying this fundamental tension between performance-boosting (i.e., complementarity) and trust-building (i.e., alignment) as an inherent limitation of the traditional approach for training a single AI model to assist human decision making. To overcome this, we introduce a novel human-centered adaptive AI ensemble that strategically toggles between two specialist AI models - the aligned model and the complementary model - based on contextual cues, using an elegantly simple yet provably near-optimal Rational Routing Shortcut mechanism. Comprehensive theoretical analyses elucidate why the adaptive AI ensemble is effective and when it yields maximum benefits. Moreover, experiments on both simulated and real-world data show that when humans are assisted by the adaptive AI ensemble in decision making, they can achieve significantly higher performance than when they are assisted by single AI models that are trained to either optimize for their independent performance or even the human-AI team performance."}

In this work, we scale RLVR by introducing ReSyn, a pipeline that generates diverse reasoning environments equipped with instance generators and verifiers, covering tasks such as constraint satisfaction, algorithmic puzzles, and spatial reasoning. A Qwen2.5-7B-Instruct model trained with RL on ReSyn data achieves consistent gains across reasoning benchmarks and out-of-domain math benchmarks, including a 27\\% relative improvement on the challenging BBEH benchmark.

Recent Hybrid Structural Methods (HSMs) use Monte Carlo rollouts for the common noise in combination with exact estimation of the expected return, conditioned on those samples.

To achieve a more robust and reliable representation, we design a novel trustworthy information fusion strategy. It first combines diverse features and patterns across sub-regions to enhance information richness, and then performs local-global information fusion by balancing fine-grained details with coarse-grained context. Moreover, DEFNet exploits advanced uncertainty estimation technique inspired by evidential learning with the help of normal-inverse gamma distribution mixture. Extensive experiments on both synthetic and authentic distortion datasets demonstrate the effectiveness and robustness of the proposed framework.

To acquire more realistic textures, generative methods are often used to extract Physically-based Rendering (PBR) textures and materials from large collections of wild images and project them back onto garment meshes. However, most image-conditioned texture generation approaches require strict topological consistency between the input image and the input 3D mesh, or rely on accurate mesh deformation to match to the image poses, which significantly constrains the texture generation quality and flexibility. To address the challenging problem of non-isometric image-based garment texture generation, we construct 3D Garment Videos, a physically simulated, garment-centric dataset that provides consistent geometry and material supervision across diverse deformations, enabling robust cross-pose texture learning. We further employ Nano Banana for high-quality non-isometric image editing, achieving reliable cross-topology texture generation between non-isometric image-geometry pairs. Finally, we propose an iterative baking method via uncertainty-guided view selection and reweighting that fuses multi-view predictions into seamless, production-ready PBR textures. Through extensive experiments, we demonstrate that our feedforward dual-branch architecture generates versatile and spatially aligned PBR materials suitable for industry-level 3D garment design."}

Although Model-Based Definition (MBD) allows such specifications to be embedded directly in 3D models, 2D drawings remain the primary carrier of manufacturing intent in automotive, aerospace, shipbuilding, and heavy-machinery industries. Correctly linking drawing annotations to the corresponding 3D features is difficult because of contextual ambiguity, repeated feature patterns, and the need for transparent and traceable decisions. This paper presents a deterministic-first, context-aware framework that maps 2D drawing entities to 3D CAD features to produce a unified manufacturing specification. Drawing callouts are first semantically enriched and then scored against candidate features using an interpretable metric that combines type compatibility, tolerance-aware dimensional agreement, and conservative context consistency, along with engineering-domain heuristics. When deterministic scoring cannot resolve an ambiguity, the system escalates to multimodal and constrained large-language-model reasoning, followed by a single human-in-the-loop (HITL) review step. Experiments on 20 real CAD-drawing pairs achieve a mean precision of 83.67%, recall of 90.46%, and F1 score of 86.29%. An ablation study shows that each pipeline component contributes to overall accuracy, with the full system outperforming all reduced variants. By prioritizing deterministic rules, clear decision tracking, and retaining unresolved cases for human review, the framework provides a practical foundation for downstream manufacturing automation in real-world industrial environments."}

Moreover, the prevailing single-pass paradigm struggles to deliver optimal answers in long-form generation that requiring multiple citations. To address these limitations, we propose FineRef, a framework based on Fine-grained error Reflection, which explicitly teaches the model to self-identify and correct two key citation errors, mismatch and irrelevance, on a per-citation basis. FineRef follows a two-stage training strategy. The first stage instills an \"attempt-reflect-correct\" behavioral pattern via supervised fine-tuning, using fine-grained and controllable reflection data constructed by specialized lightweight models. An online self-reflective bootstrapping strategy is designed to improve generalization by iteratively enriching training data with verified, self-improving examples. To further enhance the self-reflection and correction capability, the second stage applies process-level reinforcement learning with a multi-dimensional reward scheme that promotes reflection accuracy, answer quality, and correction gain. Experiments on the ALCE benchmark demonstrate that FineRef significantly improves both citation performance and answer accuracy. Our 7B model outperforms GPT-4 by up to 18% in Citation F1 and 4% in EM Recall, while also surpassing the state-of-the-art model across key evaluation metrics.

In this context, the practical reliability of such reports hinges on logical quality: whether the report's claims and arguments are explicitly supported and can be trusted as a basis for downstream use, rather than merely appearing fluent or informative. However, current evaluation frameworks largely overlook this requirement. To bridge this gap, we introduce ReportLogic, a benchmark that quantifies report-level logical quality through a reader-centric lens of auditability. Specifically, ReportLogic adopts a hierarchical taxonomy that evaluates whether readers can (1) trace an on-topic report structure with a unified analytical arc (Macro-Logic), (2) understand the progression with necessary context (Expositional-Logic), and (3) verify conclusions via explicit claim--support (Structural-Logic). Based on this taxonomy, we construct a human-annotated rubric-guided dataset and train an open-source LogicJudge for scalable evaluation. We further evaluate judge robustness via adversarial attacks, showing that off-the-shelf LLM judges are frequently influenced by superficial cues (e.g., verbosity), and reasoning modes can mask broken support relations. Overall, our results provide actionable guidance for building more robust logic evaluators and improving the logical reliability of LLM-generated reports."}

We propose ConfSpec, a confidence-gated cascaded verification framework that resolves this trade-off. Our key insight is an asymmetry between generation and verification: while generating a correct reasoning step requires substantial model capacity, step-level verification is a constrained discriminative task for which small draft models are well-calibrated within their competence range, enabling high-confidence draft decisions to be accepted directly while selectively escalating uncertain cases to the large target model. Evaluation across diverse workloads shows that ConfSpec achieves up to 2.24$\\times$ end-to-end speedups while matching target-model accuracy. Our method requires no external judge models and is orthogonal to token-level speculative decoding, enabling further multiplicative acceleration."}

To elicit such higher-order ability, educators need performance-based assessments, which are challenging to develop. One solution that has been broadly adopted is Evidence-Centered Design (ECD), which emphasizes interconnected models of the learner, evidence, and tasks. Although ECD provides a framework to safeguard assessment validity, its implementation requires diverse expertise (e.g., content and assessment), which is both costly and labor-intensive. To address this challenge, this study proposed integrating the ECD framework into Multi-Agent Systems (MAS) to generate NGSS-aligned assessment items automatically. This integrated MAS system ensembles multiple large language models with varying expertise, enabling the automation of complex, multi-stage item generation workflows traditionally performed by human experts. We examined the quality of AI-generated NGSS-aligned items and compared them with human-developed items across multiple dimensions of assessment design. Results showed that AI-generated items have overall comparable quality to human-developed items in terms of alignment with NGSS three-dimensional standards and cognitive demands. Divergent patterns also emerged: AI-generated items demonstrated a distinct strength in inclusivity, while also exhibiting limitations in clarity, conciseness, and multimodal design. AI- and human-developed items both showed weaknesses in evidence collectability and student interest alignment. These findings suggest that integrating ECD into MAS can support scalable and standards-aligned assessment design, while human expertise remains essential."}

This paper argues that evaluating AI agents in isolation systematically mischaracterizes their operational safety when deployed within human-in-the-loop environments. Using a recent laboratory safety benchmark as a case study demonstrates that even imperfect AI systems can nonetheless provide substantial safety utility by functioning as redundant audit layers against well-documented sources of human failure, including vigilance decrement, inattentional blindness, and normalization of deviance. This perspective reframes agentic safety evaluation around the reliability of the human-AI dyad rather than absolute agent accuracy, with a particular emphasis on uncorrelated error modes as the primary determinant of risk reduction. Such a shift aligns AI benchmarking with established practices in other safety-critical domains and offers a path toward more ecologically valid safety assessments."}

Because identity is often part of the inferential substrate of competent judgment, ethical alignment requires regulating when and how systems invoke identity. Yet the dominant governance regime for identity-related harm remains bias mitigation, which treats identity primarily as a source of measurable disparities or harmful associations to be detected and suppressed. This leaves underspecified a positive, context-sensitive role for identity in interpretation. We call this governance problem bias negotiation: the normative regulation of identity-conditioned judgments of sociocultural relevance, inference, and justification. Empirically, we probe the feasibility of bias negotiation through semi-structured interviews with multiple publicly deployed chatbots. We identify recurring repertoires for negotiating identity including probabilistic framing of group tendencies and harm-value balancing. We also observe failure modes in which models avoid hard tradeoffs or apply principles inconsistently. Bias negotiation matters for justice because a positive role for sociocultural reasoning is required to recognize and potentially remediate structural inequities. But it is equally implicated in core model functionality as sociocultural competence is needed for systems that operate across heterogeneous cultural contexts. Because bias negotiation is a procedural capability expressed through deliberation and interaction, it cannot be validated by static benchmarks alone. To support targeted training, we introduce a broad but explicit framework that decomposes bias negotiation into an action space of negotiation moves (what to observe and score) and a complementary set of case features (over which the model negotiates), enabling systematic test-suite design and evaluation."}

While market enthusiasm suggests a revolution in healthcare agents, the conceptual assumptions and accountability structures shaping these systems remain underexamined. We present a qualitative study based on interviews with 20 stakeholders, including developers, implementers, and end users. Our analysis identifies three mutually reinforcing tensions: conceptual fragmentation regarding the definition of `agentic'; an autonomy contradiction where commercial promises exceed operational reality; and an evaluation blind spot that prioritizes technical benchmarks over sociotechnical safety. We argue that agentic {AI} functions as a site of contested meaning-making where technical aspirations, commercial incentives, and clinical constraints intersect, carrying material consequences for patient safety and the distribution of blame."}

Yet, it remains unclear whether multi-attribute persona prompting improves LLM reliability or instead introduces distortions. Here we contribute to this assessment by leveraging a large dataset of U.S. microdata from the World Values Survey. Concretely, we evaluate two open-weight chat models and a random-guesser baseline across more than 70K respondent-item instances. We find that persona prompting does not yield a clear aggregate improvement in survey alignment and, in many cases, significantly degrades performance. Persona effects are highly heterogeneous as most items exhibit minimal change, while a small subset of questions and underrepresented subgroups experience disproportionate distortions. Our findings highlight a key adverse impact of current persona-based simulation practices: demographic conditioning can redistribute error in ways that undermine subgroup fidelity and risk misleading downstream analyses."}

We interrogate this assumption using SP-ABCBench, a new benchmark of 30 tests derived from validated S&P human-subject studies, which measures alignment between simulations and human-subjects studies on a 0-100 ascending scale, where higher scores indicate better alignment across three dimensions: Attitude, Behavior, and Coherence.

We address this gap with SciIBI, the first video benchmark for analyzing science classroom discourse, featuring 113 NGSS-aligned clips annotated with Core Instructional Practices (CIP) and sophistication levels. By evaluating eight state-of-the-art LLMs and Multimodal LLMs, we reveal fundamental limitations: current models struggle to distinguish pedagogically similar practices, suggesting that CIP coding requires instructional reasoning beyond surface pattern matching. Furthermore, adding video input yields inconsistent gains across architectures. Crucially, our evidence-based evaluation reveals that models often succeed through surface shortcuts rather than genuine pedagogical understanding. These findings establish science classroom discourse as a challenging frontier for multimodal AI and point toward human-AI collaboration, where models retrieve evidence to accelerate expert review rather than replace it."}

Positioned at the intersection of tradition and innovation, AI is altering educational goals, procedures, learning materials, assessment practices, and desired outcomes. We highlight how AI-supported tools, such as intelligent tutoring systems, adaptive learning platforms, automated feedback, and generative content creation--enhance personalization, efficiency, and equity while fostering competencies essential for an AI-driven society, including critical thinking, creativity, and interdisciplinary collaboration. At the same time, this chapter examines the ethical, social, and pedagogical challenges that arise, particularly issues of fairness, transparency, accountability, privacy, and human oversight. To address these tensions, we argue that a Responsible and Ethical Principles (REP) framework is needed to offer guidance for aligning AI integration with values of fairness, scientific integrity, and democratic participation. Through this lens, we synthesize the changes brought to each of the five transformative aspects and the approaches introduced to meet the changes according to the REP framework. We argue that AI should be viewed not as a replacement for human teachers and learners but as a partner that supports inquiry, enriches assessment, and expands access to authentic scientific practices. Aside from what is changing, we conclude by exploring the roles that remain uniquely human, engaging as moral and relational anchors in classrooms, bringing interpretive and ethical judgement, fostering creativity, imagination, and curiosity, and co-constructing meaning through dialogue and community, and assert that these qualities must remain central if AI is to advance equity, integrity, and human flourishing in science education."}

This chapter examines how AI technologies are transforming science learning materials across six interrelated domains: 1) integrating AI into scientific practice, 2) enabling adaptive and personalized instruction, 3) facilitating interactive simulations, 4) generating multimodal content, 5) enhancing accessibility for diverse learners, and 6) promoting co-creation through AI-supported content development. These advancements enable learning materials to more accurately reflect contemporary scientific practice, catering to the diverse needs of students. For instance, AI support can enable students to engage in dynamic simulations, interact with real-time data, and explore science concepts through multimodal representations. Educators are increasingly collaborating with generative AI tools to develop timely and culturally responsive instructional resources. However, these innovations also raise critical ethical and pedagogical concerns, including issues of algorithmic bias, data privacy, transparency, and the need for human oversight. To ensure equitable and meaningful science learning, we emphasize the importance of designing AI-supported materials with careful attention to scientific integrity, inclusivity, and student agency. This chapter advocates for a responsible, ethical, and reflective approach to leveraging AI in science education, framing it as a catalyst for innovation while upholding core educational values."}

The REP framework, emphasizing fairness, transparency, privacy, accountability, and respect for human values, anchors our vision for AI-supported science education. Key discussions include the redefinition of scientific literacy to encompass AI literacy, the evolving roles of teachers and learners in AI-supported classrooms, and the design of adaptive learning materials and assessments that preserve authenticity and integrity. We highlight both opportunities and risks, stressing the need for critical engagement with AI to avoid reinforcing inequities or undermining human agency.

MedTS data typically exhibit two critical patterns: temporal dependencies within individual channels and channel dependencies across multiple channels. While recent advances in deep learning have leveraged Transformer-based models to effectively capture temporal dependencies, they often struggle with modeling channel dependencies. This limitation stems from a structural mismatch: MedTS signals are inherently centralized, whereas the Transformer's attention mechanism is decentralized, making it less effective at capturing global synchronization and unified waveform patterns. To address this mismatch, we propose CoTAR (Core Token Aggregation-Redistribution), a centralized MLP-based module designed to replace decentralized attention. Instead of allowing all tokens to interact directly, as in standard attention, CoTAR introduces a global core token that serves as a proxy to facilitate inter-token interactions, thereby enforcing a centralized aggregation and redistribution strategy. This design not only better aligns with the centralized nature of MedTS signals but also reduces computational complexity from quadratic to linear. Experiments on five benchmarks validate the superiority of our method in both effectiveness and efficiency, achieving up to a 12.13% improvement on the APAVA dataset, while using only 33% of the memory and 20% of the inference time compared to the previous state of the art.

Conventional physics-based energy functions are often computationally expensive, limiting their utility in large-scale screening. In contrast, deep learning-based scoring models offer improved computational efficiency but frequently suffer from limited cross-target generalization and poor interpretability, which restrict their practical applicability. Here we present BioLM-Score, a simple yet generalizable protein-ligand scoring model that couples geometric modeling with representation learning. Specifically, it employs modality-specific and structure-aware encoders for proteins and ligands, each augmented with biomolecular language models to enrich structural and chemical representations. Subsequently, these representations are integrated through a mixture density network to predict multimodal interatomic distance distributions, from which statistically grounded likelihood-based scores are derived. Evaluations on the CASF-2016 benchmark demonstrate that BioLM-Score achieves significant improvements across docking, scoring, ranking, and screening tasks. Moreover, the proposed scoring function serves as an effective optimization objective for guiding docking protocols and conformational search. In summary, BioLM-Score provides a principled and practical alternative to existing scoring functions, combining efficiency, generalization, and interpretability for structure-based drug discovery."}

AgentCAT serves as an alternative to overcome the long-standing data bottleneck in chemical engineering field, and its natural language based interactive data analysis functionality is friendly to the community. AgentCAT also presents a formal abstraction and challenge analysis of the catalytic reaction data extraction task in an artificial intelligence-friendly manner. This abstraction would help the artificial intelligence community understand this problem and in turn would attract more attention to address it. Technically, the complex catalytic process leads to complicated dependency structure in catalytic reaction data with respect to elementary reaction steps, molecular behaviors, measurement evidence, etc. This dependency structure makes it challenging to guarantee the correctness and completeness of data extraction, as well as representing them for analysis. AgentCAT addresses this challenge and it makes four folds of technical contributions: (1) a schema-governed extraction pipeline with progressive schema evolution, enabling robust data extraction from chemical engineering papers; (2) a dependency-aware reaction-network knowledge graph that links catalysts/active sites, synthesis-derived descriptors, mechanistic claims with evidence, and macroscopic outcomes, preserving process coupling and traceability; (3) a general querying module that supports natural-language exploration and visualization over the constructed graph for cross-paper analysis; (4) an evaluation on $\\sim$800 peer-reviewed chemical engineering publications demonstrating the effectiveness of AgentCAT."}

However, current evaluations of real-time trading performance overlook a critical failure mode: severe behavioral instability in sequential decision-making under uncertainty. We empirically show that LLM-based trading agents exhibit extreme run-to-run variance, inconsistent action sequences even under deterministic decoding, and irrational action flipping across adjacent time steps. These issues stem from stateless autoregressive architectures lacking persistent action memory, as well as sensitivity to continuous-to-discrete action mappings in portfolio allocation. As a result, many existing financial trading benchmarks produce unreliable, non-reproducible, and uninformative evaluations. To address these limitations, we propose AlphaForgeBench, a principled framework that reframes LLMs as quantitative researchers rather than execution agents. Instead of emitting trading actions, LLMs generate executable alpha factors and factor-based strategies grounded in financial reasoning. This design decouples reasoning from execution, enabling fully deterministic and reproducible evaluation while aligning with real-world quantitative research workflows. Experiments across multiple state-of-the-art LLMs show that AlphaForgeBench eliminates execution-induced instability and provides a rigorous benchmark for assessing financial reasoning, strategy formulation, and alpha discovery."}

Because adversarial datasets determine the scope and accuracy of model evaluations, they are critical artifacts for assessing potential harms from large language models. Our contributions are first, empirical evidence of practitioners conceptualizing red teaming and developing and evaluating red teaming datasets. Second, we reflect on how practitioners' conceptualization of risk leads to overlooking the context, interaction type, and user specificity.

While this pass-by-pass paradigm offers engineering benefits, it suffers from a pass coordination problem: locally beneficial transformations may block more profitable optimizations in later stages. This limitation stems from the lack of an explicit notion of optimization intent, defined as a holistic strategy for coordinating multiple transformations toward a global performance objective. Recent LLM-based approaches formulate IR optimization as an end-to-end generation task, thereby avoiding the traditional pass-by-pass structure. However, optimization intent remains implicit in these methods, forcing models to jointly infer optimization strategy and generate low-level transformations, which limits both correctness and performance. We propose IntOpt, the first intent-driven IR optimizer that explicitly separates high-level optimization intent from low-level analysis and transformation.

While a prevailing hypothesis posits that \"Reasoning\" or \"Chain-of-Thought\" Models possess safety advantages due to their ability to self-correct, emerging research suggests these capabilities may enable more sophisticated alignment failures. This qualitative Red-Teaming case study challenges the safety-through-reasoning premise using the Qwen 3 30B architecture. By subjecting both a standard instruction-tuned model and a reasoning-enhanced model to a \"Trojan Horse\" curriculum vitae, distinct failure modes are observed. The results suggest a complex trade-off: while the Standard Model resorted to brittle hallucinations to justify simple attacks and filtered out illogical constraints in complex scenarios, the Reasoning Model displayed a dangerous duality. It employed advanced strategic reframing to make simple attacks highly persuasive, yet exhibited \"Meta-Cognitive Leakage\" when faced with logically convoluted commands. This study highlights a failure mode where the cognitive load of processing complex adversarial instructions causes the injection logic to be unintentionally printed in the final output, rendering the attack more detectable by humans than in Standard Models."}

Among recent advances in deep learning, evolutionary neural networks have been developed to successively capture the temporal dynamics of time-dependent PDEs via parameter evolution. The parameter updates are obtained by solving a linear system derived from the governing equation residuals at each time step. However, strong-form evolutionary approaches can yield ill-conditioned linear systems due to pointwise residual discretization, and their computational cost scales unfavorably with the number of training samples. To address these limitations, we propose a weak-form evolutionary Kolmogorov-Arnold Network (KAN) for the scalable and accurate prediction of PDE solutions. We decouple the linear system size from the number of training samples through the weak formulation, leading to improved scalability compared to strong-form approaches. We also rigorously enforce boundary conditions by constructing the trial space with boundary-constrained KANs to satisfy Dirichlet and periodic conditions, and by incorporating derivative boundary conditions directly into the weak formulation for Neumann conditions. In conclusion, the proposed weak-form evolutionary KAN framework provides a stable and scalable approach for PDEs and contributes to scientific machine learning with potential relevance to future engineering applications."}

We evaluate on two synthetic micro-benchmarks, FBD-10 (free-body diagrams) and Circuit-10 (circuit schematics), each with 500 images spanning standard and hard noise augmentation tiers, comparing our pipeline against end-to-end LMMs (LLaVA-1.5-7B, Qwen2-VL-7B), a vision-only detector, a YOLOv8-nano learned detector, and an ensemble oracle. On n=100 test samples per benchmark with 95% bootstrap CIs, results are mixed and instructive: Qwen2-VL-7B achieves the highest micro-F1 on both FBDs (0.570) and circuits (0.528), but with extreme hallucination rates (0.78, 0.98). An ensemble oracle that selects the best prediction per sample reaches F1=0.556 with hallucination 0.320 on FBDs, demonstrating exploitable complementarity between grammar and end-to-end approaches. Confidence thresholding at tau=0.7 reduces circuit hallucination from 0.970 to 0.880 with no F1 loss. Hard noise augmentation reveals domain-dependent robustness: FBD detection is resilient while circuit detection degrades sharply.

This paper presents a novel, explainable, and individualized approach for stress prediction using physiological data from consumer-grade smartwatches.

Our evaluation involves 16 participants monitored for 10-15 weeks. We evaluate our approach across 16 participants, comparing against state-of-the-art time series models (Informer, TimesNet, PatchTST) and traditional baselines (CNN, LSTM, CNN-LSTM) across multiple temporal horizons. Our model achieved performance with an MSE of 0.053, MAE of 0.190, and RMSE of 0.226 in optimal settings (5-day input, 1-day prediction). A comparison with the baseline models shows that our model outperforms TimesNet, PatchTST, CNN-LSTM, LSTM, and CNN under all conditions, representing improvements of 36.9%, 25.5%, and 21.5% over the best baseline. According to the explanability analysis, sleep metrics are the most dominant and consistent stress predictors (importance: 1.1, consistency: 0.9-1.0), while activity features exhibit high inter-participant variability (0.1-0.2). Most notably, the model captures individual-specific patterns where identical features can have opposing effects across users, validating its personalization capabilities. These findings establish that consumer wearables, combined with adaptive and interpretable deep learning, can deliver relevant stress assessment adapted to individual physiological responses, providing a foundation for scalable, continuous, explainable mental health monitoring in real-world settings."}

We extend geometric analysis to multi-task modular arithmetic, training shared-trunk Transformers on dual-task (mod-add + mod-mul) and tri-task (mod-add + mod-mul + mod-sq) objectives across a systematic weight decay sweep. Five consistent phenomena emerge. (1) Staggered grokking order: multiplication generalizes first, followed by squaring, then addition, with consistent delays across seeds. (2) Universal integrability: optimization trajectories remain confined to an empirically invariant low-dimensional execution manifold; commutator defects orthogonal to this manifold reliably precede generalization. (3) Weight decay phase structure: grokking timescale, curvature depth, reconstruction threshold, and defect lead covary systematically with weight decay, revealing distinct dynamical regimes and a sharp no-decay failure mode. (4) Holographic incompressibility: final solutions occupy only 4--8 principal trajectory directions yet are distributed across full-rank weights and destroyed by minimal perturbations; SVD truncation, magnitude pruning, and uniform scaling all fail to preserve performance. (5) Transverse fragility and redundancy: removing less than 10% of orthogonal gradient components eliminates grokking, yet dual-task models exhibit partial recovery under extreme deletion, suggesting redundant center manifolds enabled by overparameterization. Together, these results support a dynamical picture in which multi-task grokking constructs a compact superposition subspace in parameter space, with weight decay acting as compression pressure and excess parameters supplying geometric redundancy in optimization pathways."}

Although Reinforcement Learning (RL) has been proposed for solving Optimal Power Flow (OPF) problems, the requirement for iterative interaction with an environment often necessitates computationally expensive simulators, leading to significant sample inefficiency. In this study, these challenges are addressed through the use of Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs), which can replace conventional and costly smart grid simulators. The RL policy learning process is enhanced so that convergence can be achieved in a fraction of the time required by the original environment. The PINN-based surrogate is compared with other benchmark data-driven surrogate models. By incorporating knowledge of the underlying physical laws, the results show that the PINN surrogate is the only approach considered in this context that can obtain a strong RL policy even without access to samples from the true simulator. The results demonstrate that using PINN surrogates can accelerate training by 50% compared to RL training without a surrogate. This approach enables the rapid generation of performance scores similar to those produced by the original simulator."}

However, models trained on one cohort or device often fail on new acquisition settings due to cross-device and cross-cohort domain shift. This challenge is amplified in real-world scenarios with partial-label mismatch, where datasets may contain different disease labels and only partially overlap in class space. In addition, voice-based models may exploit demographic cues, raising concerns about gender-related unfairness, particularly when deployed across heterogeneous cohorts. To tackle these challenges, we propose a hybrid framework for unified three-class (healthy/PD/ALS) cross-domain voice classification from partially overlapping cohorts. The method combines style-based domain generalization with conditional adversarial alignment tailored to partial-label settings, reducing negative transfer. An additional adversarial gender branch promotes gender-invariant representations. We conduct a comprehensive evaluation across four heterogeneous sustained-vowel datasets, spanning distinct acquisition settings and devices, under both domain generalization and unsupervised domain adaptation protocols. The proposed approach is compared against twelve state-of-the-art machine learning and deep learning methods, and further evaluated through three targeted ablations, providing the first cross-cohort benchmark and end-to-end domain-adaptive framework for unified healthy/PD/ALS voice classification under partial-label mismatch and fairness constraints.

We posit that there is a wealth of rich runtime information that developers routinely access while debugging code, which agents are currently deprived of due to design limitations.

To make selection scalable, many approaches leverage optimizer statistics (e.g., Adam states) as an axis-aligned surrogate for update geometry (i.e., diagonal precondition), implicitly treating parameters as coordinate-wise independent. We show that this assumption breaks down in parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) methods such as LoRA. In this setting, the induced optimization geometry exhibits strong cross-parameter coupling with non-trivial off-diagonal interactions, while the task-relevant update directions are confined to a low-dimensional subspace. Motivated by this mismatch, we propose GIST (Gradient Isometric Subspace Transformation), a simple yet principled alternative that replaces axis-aligned scaling with robust subspace alignment. GIST recovers a task-specific subspace from validation gradients via spectral filtering (SVD), projects training gradients into this coupled subspace, and scores examples by their alignment with target directions.Extensive experiments have demonstrated that GIST matches or outperforms the state-of-the-art baseline with only 0.29% of the storage and 25% of the computational time under the same selection budget."}

Understanding user experiences with these resources is essential for identifying and addressing persistent support gaps. Towards this, we interviewed 14 blind users who regularly engage with forums and GenAI tools. Findings revealed that forums often overwhelm users with multiple overlapping topics, redundant or irrelevant content, and fragmented responses that must be mentally pieced together, increasing cognitive load. GenAI tools, while offering more direct assistance, introduce new barriers by producing unreliable answers, including overly verbose or fragmented guidance, fabricated information, and contradictory suggestions that fail to follow prompts, thereby heightening verification demands. Based on these insights, we outlined design opportunities to improve the reliability of assistive resources, aiming to provide blind users with more trustworthy and cognitively-manageable support."}

Teaching a model new capabilities requires modifying those same weights, inevitably degrading previously acquired knowledge. This fundamental limitation, known as catastrophic forgetting, has resisted principled solutions for decades. Existing approaches treat weights as immutable artifacts that must be protected through techniques like regularization heuristics, replay buffers, or isolated adapter modules. The problem is none of these provide a structural guarantee against forgetting. In this work, we propose Non-Interfering Weight Fields (NIWF), a framework that replaces the fixed weight paradigm with a learned function that generates weight configurations on demand from a continuous capability coordinate space. After training on a task, we commit the occupied coordinate region by snapshotting the fields outputs on anchor points to enforce a functional lock during all future training. We validate NIWF on sequential instructionfollowing and code generation tasks using Mistral-7B, demonstrating zero forgetting on committed tasks with competitive perplexity on new tasks. The framework introduces the notion of software-like versioning for neural network intelligence, where capabilities can be committed, extended, composed, and rolled back without retraining."}

Based on these insight, we introduce InfoNoise, a principled data-adaptive training noise schedule that replaces heuristic schedule design with an information-guided noise sampling distribution derived from entropy-reduction rates estimated from denoising losses already computed during training. Across natural-image benchmarks, InfoNoise matches or surpasses tuned EDM-style schedules, in some cases with a substantial training speedup (about $1.4\\times$ on CIFAR-10). On discrete datasets, where standard image-tuned schedules exhibit significant mismatch, it reaches superior quality in up to $3\\times$ fewer training steps.

Across three model scales (315K--2.2M parameters) and five weight decay settings, we compare three reconstruction methods: per-matrix SVD, joint cross-matrix SVD, and trajectory PCA.\n  Across all conditions, grokking trajectories are confined to a 2--6 dimensional global subspace, while individual weight matrices remain effectively full-rank.

We introduce NutriOrion, a hierarchical multi-agent framework with a parallel-then-sequential reasoning topology. NutriOrion decomposes nutrition planning into specialized domain agents with isolated contexts to mitigate anchoring bias, followed by a conditional refinement stage. The framework includes a multi-objective prioritization algorithm to resolve conflicting dietary requirements and a safety constraint mechanism that injects pharmacological contraindications as hard negative constraints during synthesis, ensuring clinical validity by construction rather than post-hoc filtering. For clinical interoperability, NutriOrion maps synthesized insights into the ADIME standard and FHIR R4 resources. Evaluated on 330 stroke patients with multimorbidity, NutriOrion outperforms multiple baselines, including GPT-4.1 and alternative multi-agent architectures. It achieves a 12.1 percent drug-food interaction violation rate, demonstrates strong personalization with negative correlations (-0.26 to -0.35) between patient biomarkers and recommended risk nutrients, and yields clinically meaningful dietary improvements, including a 167 percent increase in fiber and a 27 percent increase in potassium, alongside reductions in sodium (9 percent) and sugars (12 percent)."}

Unfortunately, heterogeneous antenna hardware with varying dimensions, orientations, codebooks, element patterns, and polarization angles limits their feasibility and generalization. This challenge requires either a heterogeneity-agnostic model functional under these variations, or developing many models for each configuration, which is infeasible and expensive in practice. In this paper, we propose a unifying AI/ML-based beam selection algorithm supporting antenna heterogeneity by predicting wireless propagation characteristics independent of antenna configuration. We derive a reference signal received power (RSRP) model that decouples propagation characteristics from antenna configuration. We propose an optimization framework to extract propagation variables consisting of angle-of-arrival (AoA), angle-of-departure (AoD), and a matrix incorporating path gain and channel depolarization from beamformed RSRP measurements. We develop a three-stage autoregressive network to predict these variables from user location, enabling RSRP calculation and beam selection for arbitrary antenna configurations without retraining or having a separate model for each configuration. Simulation results show our heterogeneity-agnostic method provides spectral efficiency close to that of genie-aided selection both with and without antenna heterogeneity."}

We introduce I-TAP (In-Context Latent Temporal-Abstraction Planner), an offline RL framework that unifies in-context adaptation with online planning in a learned discrete temporal-abstraction space. From offline trajectories, I-TAP learns an observation-conditioned residual-quantization VAE that compresses each observation-macro-action segment into a coarse-to-fine stack of discrete residual tokens, and a temporal Transformer that autoregressively predicts these token stacks from a short recent history. The resulting sequence model acts simultaneously as a context-conditioned prior over abstract actions and a latent dynamics model. At test time, I-TAP performs Monte Carlo Tree Search directly in token space, using short histories for implicit adaptation without gradient update, and decodes selected token stacks into executable actions. Across deterministic MuJoCo, stochastic MuJoCo with per-episode latent dynamics regimes, and high-dimensional Adroit manipulation, including partially observable variants, I-TAP consistently matches or outperforms strong model-free and model-based offline baselines, demonstrating efficient and robust in-context planning under stochastic dynamics and partial observability."}

Learning-based control is effective in handling complex dynamics and represents the problem as a hybrid action space unifying discrete resource usage and continuous maneuvers. However, prior works on hybrid action space have not sufficiently captured the causal dependencies between resource usage and maneuvers. They have also overlooked the multi-modal nature of tactical decisions, both of which are critical in fast-evolving scenarios. In this paper, we propose TART, a Temporal Action Representation learning framework for Tactical resource control and subsequent maneuver generation. TART leverages contrastive learning based on a mutual information objective, designed to capture inherent temporal dependencies in resource-maneuver interactions. These learned representations are quantized into discrete codebook entries that condition the policy, capturing recurring tactical patterns and enabling multi-modal and temporally coherent behaviors. We evaluate TART in two domains where resource deployment is critical: (i) a maze navigation task where a limited budget of discrete actions provides enhanced mobility, and (ii) a high-fidelity air combat simulator in which an F-16 agent operates weapons and defensive systems in coordination with flight maneuvers. Across both domains, TART consistently outperforms hybrid-action baselines, demonstrating its effectiveness in leveraging limited resources and producing context-aware subsequent maneuvers."}

In both datasets, each sample contains two minimally differing captions and corresponding minimally differing images. In MiS, the image-caption pairs depict a safe and an unsafe scenario, while in MiC, they depict cultural proxies in two distinct cultural contexts. We find that models generally perform better at confirming the correct image-caption pair than rejecting incorrect ones. Additionally, models achieve higher accuracy when selecting the correct caption from two highly similar captions for a given image, compared to the converse task.

The framework jointly optimizes vehicle-level eco-driving behaviors and intersection-level traffic signal control to enhance overall network efficiency and decrease energy consumption. A decentralized Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL) approach by Value Decomposition Network (VDN) manages cycle-based traffic signal control (TSC) at intersections, while an innovative Signal Phase and Timing (SPaT) prediction method integrates a Machine Learning-based Trajectory Planning Algorithm (MLTPA) to guide CAVs in executing Eco-Approach and Departure (EAD) maneuvers. The framework is evaluated across varying CAV proportions and powertrain types to assess its effects on mobility and energy performance. Experimental results conducted in a 4*4 real-world network demonstrate that the MARL-based TSC method outperforms the baseline model (i.e., Webster method) in speed, fuel consumption, and idling time. In addition, with MLTPA, HONEST-CAV benefits the traffic system further in energy consumption and idling time. With a 60% CAV proportion, vehicle average speed, fuel consumption, and idling time can be improved/saved by 7.67%, 10.23%, and 45.83% compared with the baseline.

To tackle this issue, we introduce RoboCurate, a novel synthetic robot data generation framework that evaluates and filters the quality of annotated actions by comparing them with simulation replay. Specifically, RoboCurate replays the predicted actions in a simulator and assesses action quality by measuring the consistency of motion between the simulator rollout and the generated video.

UFO features a novel 2PC protocol that systematically combines the efficient Winograd convolution algorithm with quantization to improve inference efficiency. However, we observe that naively combining quantization and Winograd convolution faces the following challenges: 1) From the inference perspective, Winograd transformations introduce extensive additions and require frequent bit width conversions to avoid inference overflow, leading to non-negligible communication overhead; 2) From the training perspective, Winograd transformations introduce weight outliers that make quantization-aware training (QAT) difficult, resulting in inferior model accuracy. To address these challenges, we co-optimize both protocol and algorithm. 1) At the protocol level, we propose a series of graph-level optimizations for 2PC inference to minimize the communication. 2) At the algorithm level, we develop a mixed-precision QAT algorithm based on layer sensitivity to optimize model accuracy given communication constraints. To accommodate the outliers, we further introduce a 2PC-friendly bit re-weighting algorithm to increase the representation range without explicitly increasing bit widths.

To this end, we propose \\textbf{ICPNS (In-Community Popularity Negative Sampling)}, a novel framework that leverages user community structure to identify reliable and informative negative samples. Our approach is grounded in the insight that item exposure is driven by latent user communities. By identifying these communities and utilizing in-community popularity, ICPNS effectively approximates the probability of item exposure. Consequently, items that are popular within a user's community but remain unclicked are identified as more reliable true negatives. Extensive experiments on four benchmark datasets demonstrate that ICPNS yields consistent improvements on graph-based recommenders and competitive performance on MF-based models, outperforming representative negative sampling strategies under a unified evaluation protocol."}

We propose TAG (Thinking with Action Unit Grounding), a vision--language framework that explicitly constrains multimodal reasoning to be supported by facial Action Units (AUs). TAG requires intermediate reasoning steps to be grounded in AU-related facial regions, yielding predictions accompanied by verifiable visual evidence. The model is trained via supervised fine-tuning on AU-grounded reasoning traces followed by reinforcement learning with an AU-aware reward that aligns predicted regions with external AU detectors. Evaluated on RAF-DB, FERPlus, and AffectNet, TAG consistently outperforms strong open-source and closed-source VLM baselines while simultaneously improving visual faithfulness. Ablation and preference studies further show that AU-grounded rewards stabilize reasoning and mitigate hallucination, demonstrating the importance of structured grounded intermediate representations for trustworthy multimodal reasoning in FER.

To address limitations in existing models, we propose GLaDiGAtor (Graph Learning-bAsed DIsease-Gene AssociaTiOn pRediction), a novel GNN framework with an encoder-decoder architecture for disease-gene association prediction. GLaDiGAtor constructs a heterogeneous biological graph integrating gene-gene, disease-disease, and gene-disease interactions from curated databases, and enriches each node with contextual features from well-known language models (ProtT5 for protein sequences and BioBERT for disease text).

Spatiotemporal mismatches between stochastic task arrivals and intermittent green energy along with complex inter-user interference in multi-antenna (MIMO) uplinks complicate real-time resource management. Traditional centralized optimization and off-policy reinforcement learning struggle with scalability and signaling overhead in dense networks. This paper proposes CADDTO-PPO, a carbon-aware decentralized dynamic task offloading framework based on multi-agent proximal policy optimization. The multi-user MIMO-MEC system is modeled as a Decentralized Partially Observable Markov Decision Process (DEC-POMDP) to jointly minimize carbon emissions and buffer latency and energy wastage. A scalable architecture utilizes decentralized execution with parameter sharing (DEPS), which enables autonomous IoT agents to make fine-grained power control and offloading decisions based solely on local observations. Additionally, a carbon-first reward structure adaptively prioritizes green time slots for data transmission to decouple system throughput from grid-dependent carbon footprints. Finally, experimental results demonstrate CADDTO-PPO outperforms deep deterministic policy gradient (DDPG) and lyapunov-based baselines. The framework achieves the lowest carbon intensity and maintains near-zero packet overflow rates under extreme traffic loads. Architectural profiling validates the framework to demonstrate a constant $O(1)$ inference complexity and theoretical lightweight feasibility for future generation sustainable IoT deployments."}

However, existing techniques for evaluating this robustness are unsuitable for code generation because the input data space of natural language descriptions is discrete. To address this problem, we propose a robustness evaluation method called scenario domain analysis, which aims to find the expected minimal change in the natural language descriptions of coding tasks that would cause the LLMs to produce incorrect outputs. We have formally proved the theoretical properties of the method and also conducted extensive experiments to evaluate the robustness of four state-of-the-art art LLMs: Gemini-pro, Codex, Llamma2 and Falcon 7B, and have found that we are able to rank these with confidence from best to worst. Moreover, we have also studied how robustness varies in different scenarios, including the variations with the topic of the coding task and with the complexity of its sample solution, and found that robustness is lower for more complex tasks and also lower for more advanced topics, such as multi-threading and data structures."}

Analyzing 231,080 non-spam posts across three phases of community evolution, we find three key patterns. First, participation inequality is extreme from the start (comment Gini = 0.889), exceeding human community benchmarks. Second, AI agents exhibit a \"broadcasting inversion\": statement-to-question ratios of 8.9:1 to 9.7:1 contrast sharply with the question-driven dynamics of human learning communities, and comment-level analysis of 1.55 million comments reveals a \"parallel monologue\" pattern where 93% of comments are independent responses rather than threaded dialogue.

However, automation for these systems has been either modest in scope or complex in implementation. We aim to improve the situation by integrating proof assistants with automated theorem provers (ATPs) in a simple way, while preserving the correctness guarantees of the former. A central difficulty arises from the fact that most ATPs operate in classical first-order logic, whereas these proof assistants are grounded in constructive dependent type theory. We identify an expressive fragment of both languages -- essentially equational Horn -- that admits sound, straightforward translations in both directions. The approach produces a prototype system for Agda forwarding proof obligations to the ATP Vampire, then transforming the resulting classical proof into a constructive proof term that Agda can type-check. The prototype automatically derives proofs concerning the properties of a complex field equipped with roots of unity, which took professional Agda developers two full days to complete. The required engineering effort is modest, and we anticipate that the methodology will extend readily to other ATPs and proof assistants."}

Using this framework, we prove that pre-LN preserves identity gradient paths while post-LN compounds LayerNorm Jacobians exponentially with depth, and we show that DeepNorm's $N^{-1/4}$ emerges from the quartic structure of attention's four projection matrices. We validate our theory on 774M-parameter models and find that, contrary to the intuition that attention sharpens during training to reduce sensitivity, $θ(p) \\approx 1$ persists throughout.

We address these limitations by representing motion with continuous differentiable B-spline curves, enabling more effective motion generation without modifying the capabilities of the underlying generative model. Specifically, our closed-form, Laplacian-regularized B-spline solver efficiently compresses variable-length motion sequences into compact representations with a fixed number of control points.

We propose the Structure-Level Disentangled Diffusion Model (SLD-Font), which receives content and style information from two separate channels. SimSun-style images are used as content templates and concatenated with noisy latent features as the input. Style features extracted by a CLIP model from target-style images are integrated via cross-attention. Additionally, we train a Background Noise Removal module in the pixel space to remove background noise in complex stroke regions. Based on theoretical validation of disentanglement effectiveness, we introduce a parameter-efficient fine-tuning strategy that updates only the style-related modules. This allows the model to better adapt to new styles while avoiding overfitting to the reference images' content. We further introduce the Grey and OCR metrics to evaluate the content quality of generated characters.

Existing approaches for 3D scene representation and generation commonly use 3D data structures or view-aligned fields. In contrast, we introduce the first method that encodes scene information into a small set of permutation-invariant tokens that is disentangled from the spatial grid. The scene tokens are predicted by a multi-view tokenizer given many context views and rendered into novel views by employing a light-weight rectified flow decoder. We show that the compression is 1-3 orders of magnitude stronger than for other representations while still reaching state-of-the-art reconstruction quality. Further, our representation can be rendered from novel trajectories, including ones deviating from the input trajectory, and we show that the decoder gracefully handles uncertainty. Finally, the highly-compressed set of unstructured latent scene tokens enables simple and efficient scene generation in 5 seconds, achieving a much better quality-speed trade-off than previous paradigms."}

Using the generation and assessment of multiple-choice questions (MCQs) as a testbed, we collected 1,071 SAT Math MCQs and employed LLM agents to extract questions from PDFs, retrieve and convert open textbooks into structured representations, align each MCQ with relevant textbook content, generate new MCQs under specified difficulty and cognitive levels, and evaluate both original and generated MCQs using a 24-criterion quality framework. Across all evaluations, average MCQ quality was high. However, criterion-level analysis and equivalence testing show that generated MCQs are not fully comparable to expert-vetted baseline questions.

The focus of research in both KG embedding and GNNs has been mostly oriented towards simple graphs with binary relations. However, real-world knowledge bases have a significant share of complex and n-ary facts that cannot be represented by binary edges. More specifically, real-world knowledge bases are often a mix of two types of n-ary facts - (i) that require hyperedges and (ii) that require hyper-relational edges. Though there are research efforts catering to these n-ary fact types, they are pursued independently for each type. We propose $H$yper$E$dge $H$yper-$R$elational edge $GNN$(HEHRGNN), a unified embedding model for n-ary relational KGs with both hyperedges and hyper-relational edges.

At the instance level, we redefine reasoning traces as executable process specifications and introduce blind execution verification to assess operational validity. At the local structural level, we construct feasible-region DAGs via structure-consistent perturbations, enabling explicit characterization of reasoning stability and the executable region in the local input space.

Engineering capsids to overcome these hurdles is challenging due to the vast sequence space and the difficulty of simultaneously optimizing multiple functional properties. The complexity also adds when it comes to the kidney, which presents unique anatomical barriers and cellular targets that require precise and efficient vector engineering. Here, we present AAVGen, a generative artificial intelligence framework for de novo design of AAV capsids with enhanced multi-trait profiles. AAVGen integrates a protein language model (PLM) with supervised fine-tuning (SFT) and a reinforcement learning technique termed Group Sequence Policy Optimization (GSPO). The model is guided by a composite reward signal derived from three ESM-2-based regression predictors, each trained to predict a key property: production fitness, kidney tropism, and thermostability. Our results demonstrate that AAVGen produces a diverse library of novel VP1 protein sequences. In silico validations revealed that the majority of the generated variants have superior performance across all three employed indices, indicating successful multi-objective optimization. Furthermore, structural analysis via AlphaFold3 confirms that the generated sequences preserve the canonical capsid folding despite sequence diversification. AAVGen establishes a foundation for data-driven viral vector engineering, accelerating the development of next-generation AAV vectors with tailored functional characteristics."}

To address this limitation, we propose Adaptive Collaboration of Argumentative LLMs (ACAL), a neuro-symbolic framework that integrates adaptive multi-agent collaboration with an Arena-based Quantitative Bipolar Argumentation Framework (A-QBAF).

However, these architectures remain structurally blind to explicit user intent: they struggle to adapt when a user's immediate goal (e.g., expressed via a natural language prompt) deviates from their historical habits. While Large Language Models (LLMs) offer the semantic reasoning to interpret such intent, existing integration paradigms force a dilemma: LLM-as-a-recommender paradigm sacrifices the efficiency and collaborative precision of ID-based retrieval, while Reranking methods are inherently bottlenecked by the recall capabilities of the underlying model. In this paper, we propose Decoupled Promptable Sequential Recommendation (DPR), a model-agnostic framework that empowers conventional sequential backbones to natively support Promptable Recommendation, the ability to dynamically steer the retrieval process using natural language without abandoning collaborative signals. DPR modulates the latent user representation directly within the retrieval space. To achieve this, we introduce a Fusion module to align the collaborative and semantic signals, a Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) architecture that disentangles the conflicting gradients from positive and negative steering, and a three-stage training strategy that progressively aligns the semantic space of prompts with the collaborative space. Extensive experiments on real-world datasets demonstrate that DPR significantly outperforms state-of-the-art baselines in prompt-guided tasks while maintaining competitive performance in standard sequential recommendation scenarios."}

We hypothesize that training data are \\textit{more reconstructible} than non-members, and the difference in their reconstructibility can be exploited for membership inference. Motivated by findings that reinforcement learning (RL) sharpens behaviors already encoded in weights, we leverage on-policy RL to actively elicit data reconstruction by finetuning a policy initialized from the target model.

Unlike the traditional deep learning methods, FishProtoNet provides interpretability through learned prototype representations while improving robustness by leveraging foundation models to reduce the influence of background noise. Specifically, the FishProtoNet framework consists of three key components: fish regions of interest (ROIs) extraction using visual foundation model, feature extraction from fish ROIs and fish sex identification based on an interpretable prototype network. FishProtoNet demonstrates strong performance in delta smelt sex identification during early spawning and post-spawning stages, achieving the accuracies of 74.40% and 81.16% and corresponding F1 scores of 74.27% and 79.43% respectively.

We investigate routing-aware explanations for MoE graph models in malware detection using control flow graphs (CFGs). Our architecture builds diversity at two levels. At the node level, each layer computes multiple neighborhood statistics and fuses them with an MLP, guided by a degree reweighting factor rho and a pooling choice lambda in {mean, std, max}, producing distinct node representations that capture complementary structural cues in CFGs. At the readout level, six experts, each tied to a specific (rho, lambda) view, output graph-level logits that the router weights into a final prediction. Post-hoc explanations are generated with edge-level attributions per expert and aggregated using the router gates so the rationale reflects both what each expert highlights and how strongly it is selected. Evaluated against single-expert GNN baselines such as GCN, GIN, and GAT on the same CFG dataset, the proposed MoE achieves strong detection accuracy while yielding stable, faithful attributions under sparsity-based perturbations. The results indicate that making the router explicit and combining multi-statistic node encoding with expert-level diversity can improve the transparency of MoE decisions for malware analysis."}

Second, even sophisticated technical advances remain within the regime of Gestell (Enframing), improving calculation without questioning the primacy of calculation itself. Third, AI's lack of existential structure, specifically the absence of Care (Sorge), is genuinely explanatory: it illuminates why AI systems have no internal resources for questioning their own optimization imperatives, and why they optimize without the anxiety (Angst) that signals, in human agents, the friction between calculative absorption and authentic existence. We conclude by exploring the pedagogical value of this perspective, arguing that data science education should cultivate not only technical competence but ontological literacy--the capacity to recognize what worldviews our tools enact and when calculation itself may be the wrong mode of engagement."}

By modeling iterative feedback as a Markov Chain, we show that two conditions are needed for this resonance to occur: ergodicity of the feedback process and directional contraction of the latent representation. By studying diffusion models on MNIST and ImageNet, as well as CycleGAN and an audio feedback experiment, we map how local and global manifold geometry evolve, and we introduce an eight-pattern taxonomy of collapse behaviors.

The framework includes: (1) a retrieval agent for scalable retrieval over large video corpora, (2) a reasoning agent for zero-shot contextual temporal reasoning, and (3) a query reformulation agent for refining ambiguous queries and recovering performance for those that degrade over iterations. These agents are dynamically coordinated by an orchestration agent, which leverages intermediate feedback and reasoning outcomes to guide execution. We also introduce a novel communication mechanism that incorporates retrieval-performance memory and historical reasoning traces to improve coordination and decision-making.

From a theoretical perspective, the inverse distillation objective lacks uniqueness guarantees, which may lead to suboptimal solutions. From a practical standpoint, backpropagation in the discrete space is non-trivial and often unstable.

Specifically, both grammatical and economic valuation was found to be overly influenced by moral value, relative to human norms. This conflation was repaired by selective ablation of the activation vectors associated with morality."}

However, training deep learning models on the massive, often redundant, datasets from these domains presents a significant computational bottleneck. Existing solutions typically focus on optimizing model architectures or optimizers, while overlooking the inherent inefficiency of the training data itself. This conventional approach of iterating over the entire static dataset each epoch wastes considerable resources on easy-to-learn or repetitive samples. In this paper, we explore a novel training-efficiency techniques, namely learning from complexity with dynamic sample pruning, ST-Prune, for spatio-temporal forecasting. Through dynamic sample pruning, we aim to intelligently identify the most informative samples based on the model's real-time learning state, thereby accelerating convergence and improving training efficiency. Extensive experiments conducted on real-world spatio-temporal datasets show that ST-Prune significantly accelerates the training speed while maintaining or even improving the model performance, and it also has scalability and universality."}

Although some studies have shown that LLMs can, to a certain extent, evaluate research according to perceived quality, our understanding of the internal mechanisms that enable this capability remains limited. This paper presents the first study that investigates how LLMs encode the concept of scientific quality through relevant monosemantic features extracted using sparse autoencoders. We derive such features under different experimental settings and assess their ability to serve as predictors across three tasks related to research quality: predicting citation count, journal SJR, and journal h-index. The results indicate that LLMs encode features associated with multiple dimensions of scientific quality. In particular, we identify four recurring types of features that capture key aspects of how research quality is represented: 1) features reflecting research methodologies; 2) features related to publication type, with literature reviews typically exhibiting higher impact; 3) features associated with high-impact research fields and technologies; and 4) features corresponding to specific scientific jargons. These findings represent an important step toward understanding how LLMs encapsulate concepts related to research quality."}

Influence functions estimate how much each training sample affects a model's predictions by leveraging the gradient and Hessian of the loss function -- when labeling errors occur, influence functions can identify wrongly labeled samples in the training set, revealing the underlying failure mode. We develop a sample valuation pipeline and test it first on the MNIST dataset, then scaled to the more complex CheXpert medical imaging dataset. To examine label noise, we introduced controlled errors by flipping 20\\% of the labels for one class in the dataset.

In this work, we initiate a theoretical study of scaling laws for low-precision training within a high-dimensional sketched linear regression framework. By analyzing multiplicative (signal-dependent) and additive (signal-independent) quantization, we identify a critical dichotomy in their scaling behaviors. Our analysis reveals that while both schemes introduce an additive error and degrade the effective data size, they exhibit distinct effects on effective model size: multiplicative quantization maintains the full-precision model size, whereas additive quantization reduces the effective model size. Numerical experiments validate our theoretical findings.

With a time-multiplexed multi-AF block and a lightweight pooling and normalisation unit, the proposed vector engine supports flexible precision (4/8/16-bit) and high MAC density. The ASIC implementation results show that each MAC stage can save up to 33% of time and 21% of power, with a 256-PE configuration that achieves higher compute density (4.83 TOPS/mm2 ) and energy efficiency (11.67 TOPS/W) than previous state-of-the-art work. A detailed hardware-software co-design methodology for object detection and classification tasks on Pynq-Z2 is discussed to assess the proposed architecture, demonstrating a scalable, energy-efficient solution for edge AI applications."}

In scenarios where agents cannot confidently predict one another's intentions and plans, language communication can be crucial for ensuring safety. In this work, we focus on path-level cooperation in which agents must adapt their paths to one another in order to avoid collisions or perform physical collaboration such as joint carrying. In particular, we propose a safe and interpretable multimodal path planning method, CaPE (Code as Path Editor), which generates and updates path plans for an agent based on the environment and language communication from other agents. CaPE leverages a vision-language model (VLM) to synthesize a path editing program verified by a model-based planner, grounding communication to path plan updates in a safe and interpretable way. We evaluate our approach in diverse simulated and real-world scenarios, including multi-robot and human-robot cooperation in autonomous driving, household, and joint carrying tasks. Experimental results demonstrate that CaPE can be integrated into different robotic systems as a plug-and-play module, greatly enhancing a robot's ability to align its plan to language communication from other robots or humans. We also show that the combination of the VLM-based path editing program synthesis and model-based planning safety enables robots to achieve open-ended cooperation while maintaining safety and interpretability."}

Developing generalizable process reward models is essential for providing the fine-grained feedback necessary to bridge this gap, yet existing temporal value functions often fail to generalize beyond their training domains. We introduce TOPReward, a novel, probabilistically grounded temporal value function that leverages the latent world knowledge of pretrained video Vision-Language Models (VLMs) to estimate robotic task progress. Unlike prior methods that prompt VLMs to directly output progress values, which are prone to numerical misrepresentation, TOPReward extracts task progress directly from the VLM's internal token logits.

However, this strategy exhibits two inherent limitations. First, it suppresses noise only in the chest wall and bone regions while leaving the image background untreated. Second, it lacks a dedicated mechanism for denoising the lung parenchyma. To address these issues, we systematically redesign the original image purification strategy and propose an improved version termed IPv2. The proposed strategy introduces three core modules, namely Remove Background, Add noise, and Remove noise. These modules endow the model with denoising capability in both background and lung tissue regions during training data construction and provide a more reasonable evaluation protocol through refined label construction at the testing stage. Extensive experiments on our previously established real-world patient lung CT dataset acquired at 2% radiation dose demonstrate that IPv2 consistently improves background suppression and lung parenchyma restoration across multiple mainstream denoising models.

Samples are generated by a physics-informed simulator that captures uncertain execution of controls and ocean current forecasts while remaining computationally tractable. The simulator parameters are fitted using historical glider data. We integrate these methods into an autonomous command-and-control system for Slocum gliders that enables closed-loop replanning at each surfacing. The resulting system was validated in two field deployments in the North Sea totalling approximately 3 months and 1000 km of autonomous operation.

Existing methods use the user's query directly to retrieve personal documents, and such strategies often lead to surface-level personalization. We propose PR2 (Personalized Retrieval-Augmented Reasoning), a reinforcement learning framework that integrates reasoning and retrieval from personal context for personalization. PR2 learns adaptive retrieval-reasoning policies, determining when to retrieve, what evidence to retrieve from user profiles, and how to incorporate it into intermediate reasoning steps. By optimizing multi-turn reasoning trajectories under a personalized reward function, the framework reinforces reasoning paths that better align with user-specific preferences and contextual signals reflected by the reward model.

This survey presents a structured analysis of agentic memory from both architectural and system perspectives. We first introduce a concise taxonomy of MAG systems based on four memory structures.

The low signal-to-noise ratio and stochastic speckle patterns hinder standard self-supervised learning methods relying on a pixel-level reconstruction objective. Joint-Embedding Predictive Architectures (JEPAs) address this drawback by predicting masked latent representations rather than raw pixels. However, standard approaches depend on hyperparameter-brittle and computationally expensive online teachers updated via exponential moving average. We propose US-JEPA, a self-supervised framework that adopts the Static-teacher Asymmetric Latent Training (SALT) objective. By using a frozen, domain-specific teacher to provide stable latent targets, US-JEPA decouples student-teacher optimization and pushes the student to expand upon the semantic priors of the teacher. In addition, we provide the first rigorous comparison of all publicly available state-of-the-art ultrasound foundation models on UltraBench, a public dataset benchmark spanning multiple organs and pathological conditions. Under linear probing for diverse classification tasks, US-JEPA achieves performance competitive with or superior to domain-specific and universal vision foundation model baselines.

More specifically, we represent urban layouts using GeoJSON and decompose natural-language editing instructions into hierarchical geometric intents spanning polygon-, line-, and point-level operations. To coordinate interdependent edits across spatial elements and abstraction levels, we propose a hierarchical agentic framework that jointly performs multi-level planning and execution with explicit propagation of intermediate spatial constraints. We further introduce an iterative execution-validation mechanism that mitigates error accumulation and enforces global spatial consistency during multi-step editing. Extensive experiments across diverse urban editing scenarios demonstrate significant improvements in efficiency, robustness, correctness, and spatial validity over existing baselines."}

To address this problem, we introduce UP-Fuse, a novel uncertainty-aware fusion framework in the 2D range-view that remains robust under camera sensor degradation, calibration drift, and sensor failure. Raw LiDAR data is first projected into the range-view and encoded by a LiDAR encoder, while camera features are simultaneously extracted and projected into the same shared space. At its core, UP-Fuse employs an uncertainty-guided fusion module that dynamically modulates cross-modal interaction using predicted uncertainty maps. These maps are learned by quantifying representational divergence under diverse visual degradations, ensuring that only reliable visual cues influence the fused representation. The fused range-view features are decoded by a novel hybrid 2D-3D transformer that mitigates spatial ambiguities inherent to the 2D projection and directly predicts 3D panoptic segmentation masks.

Techniques for fast learning with non-interfering representations exist, but they generally fail to generalize. Here, we describe a Complementary Learning System (CLS) in which the fast learner entirely foregoes generalization in exchange for continual zero-shot and few-shot learning. Unlike most CLS approaches, which use episodic memory primarily for replay and consolidation, our fast, disentangled learner operates as a parallel reasoning system. The fast learner can overcome observation variability and uncertainty by leveraging a conventional slow, statistical learner within an active perception system: A contextual bias provided by the fast learner induces the slow learner to encode novel stimuli in familiar, generalized terms, enabling zero-shot and few-shot learning. This architecture demonstrates that fast, context-driven reasoning can coexist with slow, structured generalization, providing a pathway for robust continual learning."}

Specifically, our method modifies the reduction in dimensionality within each 2D pooling step from $\\frac{1}{4}$ to $\\frac{1}{2}$. This approach can also be adapted for 3D pooling to preserve even more information. Such preservation aids the U-Net in more effectively reconstructing spatial details during the up-sampling phase, thereby enhancing its ability to capture long-range information and improving segmentation accuracy. Extensive experiments on three BIS benchmarks demonstrate that the proposed Stair Pooling can increase both 2D and 3D U-Net performance by an average of 3.8\\% in Dice scores.

To address these challenges, we propose FinSight-Net, an efficient and physics-aware detection framework tailored for complex aquaculture environments. FinSight-Net introduces a Multi-Scale Decoupled Dual-Stream Processing (MS-DDSP) bottleneck that explicitly targets frequency-specific information loss via heterogeneous convolutional branches, suppressing backscattering artifacts while compensating distorted biological cues through scale-aware and channel-weighted pathways. We further design an Efficient Path Aggregation FPN (EPA-FPN) as a detail-filling mechanism: it restores high-frequency spatial information typically attenuated in deep layers by establishing long-range skip connections and pruning redundant fusion routes, enabling robust detection of non-rigid fish targets under severe blur and turbidity. Extensive experiments on DeepFish, AquaFishSet, and our challenging UW-BlurredFish benchmark demonstrate that FinSight-Net achieves state-of-the-art performance. In particular, on UW-BlurredFish, FinSight-Net reaches 92.8% mAP, outperforming YOLOv11s by 4.8% while reducing parameters by 29.0%, providing a strong and lightweight solution for real-time automated monitoring in smart aquaculture."}

We present a large empirical study of agent-authored pull requests using the public AIDev dataset, examining integration outcomes, resolution speed, and review-time collaboration signals. Using logistic regression with repository-clustered standard errors, we find that reviewer engagement has the strongest correlation with successful integration, whereas larger change sizes and coordination-disrupting actions, such as force pushes, are associated with a lower likelihood of merging. In contrast, iteration intensity alone provides limited explanatory power once collaboration signals are considered. A qualitative analysis further shows that successful integration occurs when agents engage in actionable review loops that converge toward reviewer expectations. Overall, our results highlight that the effective integration of agent-authored pull requests depends not only on code quality but also on alignment with established review and coordination practices."}

A central limitation for deep conformal classifiers is that the nonconformity scores are derived from softmax outputs, which can be unreliable indicators of how certain the model truly is about a given input, sometimes leading to overconfident misclassifications or undue hesitation. In this work, we argue that this unreliability can be inherited by the prediction sets generated by CP, limiting their capacity for adaptiveness. We propose a new approach that leverages information from the pre-softmax logit space, using the Helmholtz Free Energy as a measure of model uncertainty and sample difficulty. By reweighting nonconformity scores with a monotonic transformation of the energy score of each sample, we improve their sensitivity to input difficulty. Our experiments with four state-of-the-art score functions on multiple datasets and deep architectures show that this energy-based enhancement improves the adaptiveness of the prediction sets, leading to a notable increase in both efficiency and adaptiveness compared to baseline nonconformity scores, without introducing any post-hoc complexity."}

While deep learning approaches often focus on temporal interpolation or complex architectures to handle irregularities, we propose a simpler yet effective alternative: extracting time-agnostic summary statistics to eliminate the temporal axis. Our method computes four key features per variable-mean and standard deviation of observed values, as well as the mean and variability of changes between consecutive observations to create a fixed-dimensional representation. These features are then utilized with standard classifiers, such as logistic regression and XGBoost. Evaluated on four biomedical datasets (PhysioNet Challenge 2012, 2019, PAMAP2, and MIMIC-III), our approach achieves state-of-the-art performance, surpassing recent transformer and graph-based models by 0.5-1.7% in AUROC/AUPRC and 1.1-1.7% in accuracy/F1-score, while reducing computational complexity. Ablation studies demonstrate that feature extraction-not classifier choice-drives performance gains, and our summary statistics outperform raw/imputed input in most benchmarks. In particular, we identify scenarios where missing patterns themselves encode predictive signals, as in sepsis prediction (PhysioNet, 2019), where missing indicators alone can achieve 94.2% AUROC with XGBoost, only 1.6% lower than using original raw data as input. Our results challenge the necessity of complex temporal modeling when task objectives permit time-agnostic representations, providing an efficient and interpretable solution for irregular time series classification."}

While prior work on grokking has focused mainly on group operations, we extend the analysis to more general algebraic structures, including non-associative, non-commutative, and non-unital algebras. We show that learning group operations is a special case of learning FDA, and that learning multiplication in FDA amounts to learning a bilinear product specified by the algebra's structure tensor. For algebras over the reals, we connect the learning problem to matrix factorization with an implicit low-rank bias, and for algebras over finite fields, we show that grokking emerges naturally as models must learn discrete representations of algebraic elements. This leads us to experimentally investigate the following core questions: (i) how do algebraic properties such as commutativity, associativity, and unitality influence both the emergence and timing of grokking, (ii) how structural properties of the structure tensor of the FDA, such as sparsity and rank, influence generalization, and (iii) to what extent generalization correlates with the model learning latent embeddings aligned with the algebra's representation. Our work provides a unified framework for grokking across algebraic structures and new insights into how mathematical structure governs neural network generalization dynamics."}

However, previous Mamba-based methods utilize the bidirectional encoding for the whole non-empty voxel sequence, which contains abundant useless background information in the scenes. Though directly encoding foreground voxels appears to be a plausible solution, it tends to degrade detection performance. We attribute this to the response attenuation and restricted context representation in the linear modeling for fore-only sequences. To address this problem, we propose a novel backbone, termed Fore-Mamba3D, to focus on the foreground enhancement by modifying Mamba-based encoder. The foreground voxels are first sampled according to the predicted scores. Considering the response attenuation existing in the interaction of foreground voxels across different instances, we design a regional-to-global slide window (RGSW) to propagate the information from regional split to the entire sequence. Furthermore, a semantic-assisted and state spatial fusion module (SASFMamba) is proposed to enrich contextual representation by enhancing semantic and geometric awareness within the Mamba model. Our method emphasizes foreground-only encoding and alleviates the distance-based and causal dependencies in the linear autoregression model. The superior performance across various benchmarks demonstrates the effectiveness of Fore-Mamba3D in the 3D object detection task."}

Decision making algorithms in such partially observable environments have also shown that agents capable of lookahead over a finite horizon outperform myopic policies for active search. Unfortunately, lookahead algorithms typically rely on building a computationally expensive search tree that is simulated and updated based on the agent's observations and a model of the environment dynamics. Instead, in this work, we leverage the sequence modeling abilities of diffusion models to sample lookahead action sequences that balance the exploration-exploitation trade-off for active search without building an exhaustive search tree. We identify the optimism bias in prior diffusion based reinforcement learning approaches when applied to the active search setting and propose mitigating solutions for efficient cost-aware decision making with both single and multi-agent teams. Our proposed algorithm outperforms standard baselines in offline reinforcement learning in terms of full recovery rate and is computationally more efficient than tree search in cost-aware active decision making."}

Existing methods typically regress poses in a continuous space, but often struggle with 1) navigating a large, complex search space and 2) failing to incorporate intrinsic kinematic constraints. In this work, we introduce DICArt (DIsCrete Diffusion for Articulation Pose Estimation), a novel framework that formulates pose estimation as a conditional discrete diffusion process. Instead of operating in a continuous domain, DICArt progressively denoises a noisy pose representation through a learned reverse diffusion procedure to recover the GT pose. To improve modeling fidelity, we propose a flexible flow decider that dynamically determines whether each token should be denoised or reset, effectively balancing the real and noise distributions during diffusion. Additionally, we incorporate a hierarchical kinematic coupling strategy, estimating the pose of each rigid part hierarchically to respect the object's kinematic structure. We validate DICArt on both synthetic and real-world datasets. Experimental results demonstrate its superior performance and robustness. By integrating discrete generative modeling with structural priors, DICArt offers a new paradigm for reliable category-level 6D pose estimation in complex environments."}

Prior work often relies on GMM-HMM based forced-alignment toolkits (e.g., MFA), which are pipeline-heavy and less flexible than neural aligners; fixed-ratio interleaving of text and speech tokens struggles to capture text--speech alignment regularities. We propose CTC-TTS, which replaces MFA with a CTC based aligner and introduces a bi-word based interleaving strategy. Two variants are designed: CTC-TTS-L (token concatenation along the sequence length) for higher quality and CTC-TTS-F (embedding stacking along the feature dimension) for lower latency. Experiments show that CTC-TTS outperforms fixed-ratio interleaving and MFA-based baselines on streaming synthesis and zero-shot tasks. Speech samples are available at https://ctctts.github.io/."}

Within this context, rapid and accurate plume shine dose estimation serves as a practical test case, as it is critical for nuclear facility safety assessment and radiological emergency response, while conventional photon-transport-based calculations remain computationally expensive. In this work, an interpolation-assisted ML framework was developed using discrete dose datasets generated with the pyDOSEIA suite for 17 gamma-emitting radionuclides across varying downwind distances, release heights, and atmospheric stability categories. The datasets were augmented using shape-preserving interpolation to construct dense, high-resolution training data. Two tree-based ML models (Random Forest and XGBoost) and one deep learning (DL) model (TabNet) were evaluated to examine predictive performance and sensitivity to dataset resolution. All models showed higher prediction accuracy with the interpolated high-resolution dataset than with the discrete data; however, XGBoost consistently achieved the highest accuracy. Interpretability analysis using permutation importance (tree-based models) and attention-based feature attribution (TabNet) revealed that performance differences stem from how the models utilize input features. Tree-based models focus mainly on dominant geometry-dispersion features (release height, stability category, and downwind distance), treating radionuclide identity as a secondary input, whereas TabNet distributes attention more broadly across multiple variables. For practical deployment, a web-based GUI was developed for interactive scenario evaluation and transparent comparison with photon-transport reference calculations."}

Most existing methods either focus on globally shared representations or modality-specific features, while overlooking signals that are shared only by certain modality pairs. This limits the expressiveness and discriminative power of multimodal representations. To address this limitation, we propose a Tri-Subspace Disentanglement (TSD) framework that explicitly factorizes features into three complementary subspaces: a common subspace capturing global consistency, submodally-shared subspaces modeling pairwise cross-modal synergies, and private subspaces preserving modality-specific cues. To keep these subspaces pure and independent, we introduce a decoupling supervisor together with structured regularization losses. We further design a Subspace-Aware Cross-Attention (SACA) fusion module that adaptively models and integrates information from the three subspaces to obtain richer and more robust representations. Experiments on CMU-MOSI and CMU-MOSEI demonstrate that TSD achieves state-of-the-art performance across all key metrics, reaching 0.691 MAE on CMU-MOSI and 54.9% ACC-7 on CMU-MOSEI, and also transfers well to multimodal intent recognition tasks. Ablation studies confirm that tri-subspace disentanglement and SACA jointly enhance the modeling of multi-granular cross-modal sentiment cues."}

However, existing methods that project all modalities into a single latent space for fusion often overlook the asynchronous, multi-level semantic structure of multimodal data. This oversight induces semantic misalignment and error propagation, thereby degrading representation quality. To address this issue, we propose Cross-Level Co-Representation (CLCR), which explicitly organizes each modality's features into a three-level semantic hierarchy and specifies level-wise constraints for cross-modal interactions. First, a semantic hierarchy encoder aligns shallow, mid, and deep features across modalities, establishing a common basis for interaction. And then, at each level, an Intra-Level Co-Exchange Domain (IntraCED) factorizes features into shared and private subspaces and restricts cross-modal attention to the shared subspace via a learnable token budget. This design ensures that only shared semantics are exchanged and prevents leakage from private channels. To integrate information across levels, the Inter-Level Co-Aggregation Domain (InterCAD) synchronizes semantic scales using learned anchors, selectively fuses the shared representations, and gates private cues to form a compact task representation. We further introduce regularization terms to enforce separation of shared and private features and to minimize cross-level interference. Experiments on six benchmarks spanning emotion recognition, event localization, sentiment analysis, and action recognition show that CLCR achieves strong performance and generalizes well across tasks."}

This structural asymmetry has already produced sanctions, professional errors, and governance failures in high-stakes contexts We argue that stable human-AI coexistence is an institutional achievement that depends on governance infrastructure capable of distributing residual risk. Drawing on institutional analysis and evolutionary cooperation theory, we introduce a formal inequality that specifies when reliance on AI yields positive expected cooperative value. The model makes explicit how governance conditions, system policy, and accountability regimes jointly determine whether cooperation is rational or structurally defective. From this formalization we derive a cooperation ecology framework with six design principles: reciprocity contracts, visible trust infrastructure, conditional cooperation modes, defection-mitigation mechanisms, narrative literacy against authority theatre, and an Earth-first sustainability constraint. We operationalize the framework through three policy artefacts: a Human-AI Cooperation Charter, a Defection Risk Register, and a Cooperation Readiness Audit. Together, these elements shift the unit of analysis from the user-AI dyad to the institutional environment that shapes incentives, signals, accountability, and repair. The paper provides a theoretical foundation and practical toolkit for designing human-AI systems that can sustain accountable, trustworthy cooperation over time."}

The first two authors contributed equally", "summary": "Recent advances in text-to-image (T2I) diffusion models have seen rapid and widespread adoption. However, their powerful generative capabilities raise concerns about potential misuse for synthesizing harmful, private, or copyrighted content. To mitigate such risks, concept erasure techniques have emerged as a promising solution. Prior works have primarily focused on fine-tuning the denoising component (e.g., the U-Net backbone). However, recent causal tracing studies suggest that visual attribute information is localized in the early self-attention layers of the text encoder, indicating a potential alternative for concept erasing. Building on this insight, we conduct preliminary experiments and find that directly fine-tuning early layers can suppress target concepts but often degrades the generation quality of non-target concepts. To overcome this limitation, we propose High-Level Representation Misdirection (HiRM), which misdirects high-level semantic representations of target concepts in the text encoder toward designated vectors such as random directions or semantically defined directions (e.g., supercategories), while updating only early layers that contain causal states of visual attributes. Our decoupling strategy enables precise concept removal with minimal impact on unrelated concepts, as demonstrated by strong results on UnlearnCanvas and NSFW benchmarks across diverse targets (e.g., objects, styles, nudity). HiRM also preserves generative utility at low training cost, transfers to state-of-the-art architectures such as Flux without additional training, and shows synergistic effects with denoiser-based concept erasing methods."}

Rather than reasoning over primitive actions, we study agents that compose pre-trained policies as temporally extended actions, enabling solutions to complex tasks that no constituent alone can solve. Such compositional planning remains elusive as compounding errors in long-horizon predictions make it challenging to estimate the visitation distribution induced by sequencing policies. Motivated by the geometric policy composition framework introduced in arXiv:2206.08736, we address these challenges by learning predictive models of multi-step dynamics -- so-called jumpy world models -- that capture state occupancies induced by pre-trained policies across multiple timescales in an off-policy manner. Building on Temporal Difference Flows (arXiv:2503.09817), we enhance these models with a novel consistency objective that aligns predictions across timescales, improving long-horizon predictive accuracy. We further demonstrate how to combine these generative predictions to estimate the value of executing arbitrary sequences of policies over varying timescales. Empirically, we find that compositional planning with jumpy world models significantly improves zero-shot performance across a wide range of base policies on challenging manipulation and navigation tasks, yielding, on average, a 200% relative improvement over planning with primitive actions on long-horizon tasks."}

In this framework, measurement models are learned implicitly by minimizing a denoising score matching objective. At inference, the learned denoiser is used alongside a (learned) dynamics model to approximately solve the Bayesian filtering equation at each time step, effectively guiding predicted states toward the data manifold informed by measurements. We evaluate the proposed method on challenging robotic state estimation tasks in simulation, demonstrating competitive performance compared to tuned end-to-end trained baselines. Importantly, our method offers the desirable composability of classical filtering algorithms, allowing prior information and external sensor models to be incorporated without retraining."}

The agent maintains a persistent state vector across executions and incrementally updates it as new textual data is introduced. We quantify representational change using cosine similarity between successive normalized state vectors and define a stability metric over time intervals. Longitudinal experiments across eight executions reveal a transition from an initial plastic regime to a stable representational regime under consistent input. A deliberately introduced semantic perturbation produces a bounded decrease in similarity, followed by recovery and restabilization under subsequent coherent input. These results demonstrate that meaningful stability plasticity tradeoffs can emerge in a minimal, stateful learning system without explicit regularization, replay, or architectural complexity.

Central to this framework is a Personalised Sequential Encoder (PSE), which transforms longitudinal speech recordings into context-aware latent representations. By incorporating historical data at each timestamp, the PSE facilitates a holistic assessment of the clinical trajectory rather than modelling discrete visits independently. Experimental results from a cohort of 225 patients demonstrate that the LIPT paradigm significantly outperforms the classic cross-sectional approaches, achieving a recognition accuracy of 99.7% for clinical status transitions. The model's high sensitivity was further corroborated by additional follow-up data, confirming its efficacy in predicting HF deterioration and its potential to secure patient safety in remote, home-based settings. Furthermore, this work addresses the gap in existing literature by providing a comprehensive analysis of different speech task designs and acoustic features. Taken together, the superior performance of the LIPT framework and PSE architecture validates their readiness for integration into long-term telemonitoring systems, offering a scalable solution for remote heart failure management."}

Second, the reconstruction process is primarily driven by local geometric proximity, neglecting the human and object appearances that provide global context crucial for understanding holistic interactions. To address these issues, we introduce TeHOR, a framework built upon two core designs. First, beyond contact information, our framework leverages text descriptions of human-object interactions to enforce semantic alignment between the 3D reconstruction and its textual cues, enabling reasoning over a wider spectrum of interactions, including non-contact cases.

A fundamental challenge is that high-throughput single-cell sequencing is destructive: the same cell cannot be observed both before and after a perturbation. Thus, perturbation prediction requires mapping unpaired control and perturbed populations. Existing models address this by learning maps between distributions, but typically assume a single fixed response distribution when conditioned on observed cellular context (e.g., cell type) and the perturbation type. In reality, responses vary systematically due to unobservable latent factors such as microenvironmental fluctuations and complex batch effects, forming a manifold of possible distributions for the same observed conditions. To account for this variability, we introduce PerturbDiff, which shifts modeling from individual cells to entire distributions. By embedding distributions as points in a Hilbert space, we define a diffusion-based generative process operating directly over probability distributions. This allows PerturbDiff to capture population-level response shifts across hidden factors. Benchmarks on established datasets show that PerturbDiff achieves state-of-the-art performance in single-cell response prediction and generalizes substantially better to unseen perturbations.

However, existing methods often suffer from one or more key limitations: processing different modalities in isolation, requiring complete multimodal data for each interaction during training, or independent learning of user and item representations. These factors contribute to increased complexity and potential misalignment between user and item embeddings. To address these challenges, we propose DReX, a unified multimodal recommendation framework that incrementally refines user and item representations by leveraging interaction-level features from multimodal feedback. Our model employs gated recurrent units to selectively integrate these fine-grained features into global representations. This incremental update mechanism provides three key advantages: (1) simultaneous modeling of both nuanced interaction details and broader preference patterns, (2) eliminates the need for separate user and item feature extraction processes, leading to enhanced alignment in their learned representation, and (3) inherent robustness to varying or missing modalities. We evaluate the performance of the proposed approach on three real-world datasets containing reviews and ratings as interaction modalities. By considering review text as a modality, our approach automatically generates interpretable keyword profiles for both users and items, which supplement the recommendation process with interpretable preference indicators. Experiment results demonstrate that our approach outperforms state-of-the-art methods across all evaluated datasets."}

CAGG comprises three components: (i) an Energy and Carbon Provenance Ledger, (ii) a Carbon Budget Manager, and (iii) a Green Validation Orchestrator, operationalized through governance policies and reusable design patterns."}

However, practical composition and performance workflows frequently rely on resource-limited devices (e.g., electronic instruments and portable computers), making heavy memory and attention computation difficult to deploy. We introduce Depth-Structured Music Recurrence (DSMR), a recurrent long-context Transformer for full-piece symbolic music modeling that extends context beyond fixed-length excerpts via segment-level recurrence with detached cross-segment states, featuring a layer-wise memory-horizon schedule that budgets recurrent KV states across depth. DSMR is trained in a single left-to-right pass over each complete composition, akin to how a musician experiences it from beginning to end, while carrying recurrent cross-segment states forward. Within this recurrent framework, we systematically study how depth-wise horizon allocations affect optimization, best-checkpoint perplexity, and efficiency. By allocating different history-window lengths across layers while keeping the total recurrent-state budget fixed, DSMR creates depth-dependent temporal receptive fields within a recurrent attention stack without reducing compute depth. Our main instantiation is a two-scale DSMR schedule that allocates long history windows to lower layers and a uniform short window to the remaining layers. Experiments on the piano performance dataset MAESTRO demonstrate that two-scale DSMR provides a practical quality--efficiency recipe for full-length long-context symbolic music modeling with recurrent attention under limited computational resources."}

In this work, we propose a lightweight, machine-learning-based scanner that detects malicious Pickle-based files without policy generation or code instrumentation. Our approach statically extracts structural and semantic features from Pickle bytecode and applies supervised and unsupervised models to classify files as benign or malicious.

Transvaginal ultrasound serves as the primary, accessible screening modality in resource-constrained primary care settings; however, its diagnostic reliability is severely hindered by low tissue contrast, high operator dependence, and a pronounced scarcity of positive pathological samples. Existing artificial intelligence solutions struggle to overcome this severe class imbalance and the subtle imaging features of invasion, particularly under the strict computational limits of primary care clinics. Here we present an automated, highly efficient two-stage deep learning framework that resolves both data and computational bottlenecks in EC screening. To mitigate pathological data scarcity, we develop a structure-guided cross-modal generation network that synthesizes diverse, high-fidelity ultrasound images from unpaired magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) data, strictly preserving clinically essential anatomical junctions. Furthermore, we introduce a lightweight screening network utilizing gradient distillation, which transfers discriminative knowledge from a high-capacity teacher model to dynamically guide sparse attention towards task-critical regions.

Since MAS coordinate through unstructured natural language rather than rigid protocols, they are prone to semantic failures (e.g., hallucinations, misinterpreted instructions, and reasoning drift) that propagate silently without raising runtime exceptions. Prevailing evaluation approaches, which measure only end-to-end task success, offer limited insight into how these failures arise or how effectively agents recover from them. To bridge this gap, we propose MAS-FIRE, a systematic framework for fault injection and reliability evaluation of MAS. We define a taxonomy of 15 fault types covering intra-agent cognitive errors and inter-agent coordination failures, and inject them via three non-invasive mechanisms: prompt modification, response rewriting, and message routing manipulation. Applying MAS-FIRE to three representative MAS architectures, we uncover a rich set of fault-tolerant behaviors that we organize into four tiers: mechanism, rule, prompt, and reasoning. This tiered view enables fine-grained diagnosis of where and why systems succeed or fail. Our findings reveal that stronger foundation models do not uniformly improve robustness. We further show that architectural topology plays an equally decisive role, with iterative, closed-loop designs neutralizing over 40% of faults that cause catastrophic collapse in linear workflows. MAS-FIRE provides the process-level observability and actionable guidance needed to systematically improve multi-agent systems."}

In light of these emerging and unavoidable safety challenges, we argue that such risks should be treated as expected operational conditions rather than exceptional events, necessitating a dedicated incident-response perspective. Consequently, the primary barrier to trustworthy deployment is not further improving model capability but establishing system-level threat monitoring mechanisms that can detect and contextualize security-relevant anomalies after deployment -- an aspect largely underexplored beyond testing or guardrail-based defenses. Accordingly, this position paper advocates systematic and comprehensive monitoring of security threats in LLM-enabled applications as a prerequisite for reliable operation and a foundation for dedicated incident-response frameworks."}

Due to these assumptions, such methods fail to generalise beyond a few change types, limiting their real-world usage, especially in rare or complex scenarios. To address this, we propose MaSoN (Make Some Noise), an end-to-end UCD framework that synthesises diverse changes directly in the latent feature space during training. It generates changes that are dynamically estimated using feature statistics of target data, enabling diverse yet data-driven variation aligned with the target domain. It also easily extends to new modalities, such as SAR.

Random network distillation (RND) is a lightweight technique that measures novelty via prediction errors against a fixed random target. While empirically effective, it has remained unclear what uncertainties RND measures and how its estimates relate to other approaches, e.g. Bayesian inference or deep ensembles. This paper establishes these missing theoretical connections by analyzing RND within the neural tangent kernel framework in the limit of infinite network width. Our analysis reveals two central findings in this limit: (1) The uncertainty signal from RND -- its squared self-predictive error -- is equivalent to the predictive variance of a deep ensemble. (2) By constructing a specific RND target function, we show that the RND error distribution can be made to mirror the centered posterior predictive distribution of Bayesian inference with wide neural networks. Based on this equivalence, we moreover devise a posterior sampling algorithm that generates i.i.d. samples from an exact Bayesian posterior predictive distribution using this modified \\textit{Bayesian RND} model. Collectively, our findings provide a unified theoretical perspective that places RND within the principled frameworks of deep ensembles and Bayesian inference, and offer new avenues for efficient yet theoretically grounded uncertainty quantification methods."}

Second, attention often overemphasizes phrases lexically similar to the query, yielding biased rankings that irrelevant documents with mere lexical resemblance are regarded as relevant. In this paper, we propose \\textbf{ReAttn}, a post-hoc re-weighting strategy for attention-based re-ranking methods.

We address this gap via CORE, a safety framework that enables online contextual reasoning, grounding, and enforcement without prior knowledge of the environment (e.g., maps or safety specifications). CORE uses a vision-language model (VLM) to continuously reason about context-dependent safety rules directly from visual observations, grounds these rules in the physical environment, and enforces the resulting spatially-defined safe sets via control barrier functions. We provide probabilistic safety guarantees for CORE that account for perceptual uncertainty, and we demonstrate through simulation and real-world experiments that CORE enforces contextually appropriate behavior in unseen environments, significantly outperforming prior semantic safety methods that lack online contextual reasoning. Ablation studies validate our theoretical guarantees and underscore the importance of both VLM-based reasoning and spatial grounding for enforcing contextual safety in novel settings.

To address these issues, we propose a novel DFL framework that integrates Byzantine robustness, privacy preservation, and convergence acceleration. Within this framework, each device trains a local model using a Bayesian approach and independently selects an optimal subset of neighbors for posterior exchange. We formulate this neighbor selection as an optimization problem to minimize the global loss function under security and privacy constraints. Solving this problem is challenging because devices only possess partial network information, and the complex coupling between topology, security, and convergence remains unclear. To bridge this gap, we first analytically characterize the trade-offs between dynamic connectivity, Byzantine detection, privacy levels, and convergence speed. Leveraging these insights, we develop a fully distributed Graph Neural Network (GNN)-based Reinforcement Learning (RL) algorithm.

To this end, we propose an effective, generalizable, and model-agnostic framework with three main components: (i) residual representation encoding that capture deviations between current interactions and their historical context, providing anomaly-relevant signals; (ii) a restriction loss that constrain the normal representations within an interval bounded by two co-centered hyperspheres, ensuring consistent scales while keeping anomalies separable; (iii) a bi-boundary optimization strategy that learns a discriminative and robust boundary using the normal log-likelihood distribution modeled by a normalizing flow. Extensive experiments demonstrate the superiority of our framework across diverse evaluation settings."}

Conventional supervised losses are limited in capturing these correlations because they treat each joint independently. Previous studies have attempted to promote structural consistency through manually designed priors or rule-based constraints; however, these approaches typically require manual specification and are often non-differentiable, limiting their use as end-to-end training objectives. We propose SEAL-pose, a data-driven framework in which a learnable loss-net trains a pose-net by evaluating structural plausibility. Rather than relying on hand-crafted priors, our joint-graph-based design enables the loss-net to learn complex structural dependencies directly from data. Extensive experiments on three 3D HPE benchmarks with eight backbones show that SEAL-pose reduces per-joint errors and improves pose plausibility compared with the corresponding backbones across all settings. Beyond improving each backbone, SEAL-pose also outperforms models with explicit structural constraints, despite not enforcing any such constraints. Finally, we analyze the relationship between the loss-net and structural consistency, and evaluate SEAL-pose in cross-dataset and in-the-wild settings."}

However, in real-world scenarios, such as home environments and warehouses, clutter can block all routes. Targeted at such cases, we introduce the Lifelong Interactive Navigation problem, where a mobile robot with manipulation abilities can move clutter to forge its own path to complete sequential object- placement tasks - each involving placing an given object (eg. Alarm clock, Pillow) onto a target object (eg. Dining table, Desk, Bed). To address this lifelong setting - where effects of environment changes accumulate and have long-term effects - we propose an LLM-driven, constraint-based planning framework with active perception. Our framework allows the LLM to reason over a structured scene graph of discovered objects and obstacles, deciding which object to move, where to place it, and where to look next to discover task-relevant information. This coupling of reasoning and active perception allows the agent to explore the regions expected to contribute to task completion rather than exhaustively mapping the environment. A standard motion planner then executes the corresponding navigate-pick-place, or detour sequence, ensuring reliable low-level control. Evaluated in physics-enabled ProcTHOR-10k simulator, our approach outperforms non-learning and learning-based baselines. We further demonstrate our approach qualitatively on real-world hardware."}

Our core insight is that world models provide strong supervision signals, enabling online adaptive learning in dynamic environments, which can be complemented by force-torque feedback to mitigate dynamic force shifts. Our AdaWorldPolicy integrates a world model, an action expert, and a force predictor-all implemented as interconnected Flow Matching Diffusion Transformers (DiT). They are interconnected via the multi-modal self-attention layers, enabling deep feature exchange for joint learning while preserving their distinct modularity characteristics. We further propose a novel Online Adaptive Learning (AdaOL) strategy that dynamically switches between an Action Generation mode and a Future Imagination mode to drive reactive updates across all three modules. This creates a powerful closed-loop mechanism that adapts to both visual and physical domain shifts with minimal overhead. Across a suite of simulated and real-robot benchmarks, our AdaWorldPolicy achieves state-of-the-art performance, with dynamical adaptive capacity to out-of-distribution scenarios."}

AI agents build such conversations automatically: given an initial human prompt, a planner loop interleaves LLM calls with tool invocations and code execution. This tight coupling creates a new and poorly understood attack surface. A malicious prompt injected into a conversation can compromise later reasoning, trigger dangerous tool calls, or distort final outputs. Despite the centrality of such systems, we currently lack a principled semantic foundation for reasoning about their behaviour and safety. We address this gap by introducing an untyped call-by-value lambda calculus enriched with dynamic information-flow control and a small number of primitives for constructing prompt-response conversations. Our language includes a primitive that invokes an LLM: it serializes a value, sends it to the model as a prompt, and parses the response as a new term. This calculus faithfully represents planner loops and their vulnerabilities, including the mechanisms by which prompt injection alters subsequent computation. The semantics explicitly captures conversations, and so supports reasoning about defenses such as quarantined sub-conversations, isolation of generated code, and information-flow restrictions on what may influence an LLM call. A termination-insensitive noninterference theorem establishes integrity and confidentiality guarantees, demonstrating that a formal calculus can provide rigorous foundations for safe agentic programming."}

While their core use relies on comprehending written requests, our understanding of this ability is currently limited, because most benchmarks evaluate LLMs in high-resource languages predominantly spoken by Western, Educated, Industrialised, Rich, and Democratic (WEIRD) communities. The default assumption is that English is the best-performing language for LLMs, while smaller, low-resource languages are linked to less reliable outputs, even in multilingual, state-of-the-art models. To track variation in the comprehension abilities of LLMs, we prompt 3 popular models on a language comprehension task across 12 languages, representing the Indo-European, Afro-Asiatic, Turkic, Sino-Tibetan, and Japonic language families. Our results suggest that the models exhibit remarkable linguistic accuracy across typologically diverse languages, yet they fall behind human baselines in all of them, albeit to different degrees. Contrary to what was expected, English is not the best-performing language, as it was systematically outperformed by several Romance languages, even lower-resource ones. We frame the results by discussing the role of several factors that drive LLM performance, such as tokenization, language distance from Spanish and English, size of training data, and data origin in high- vs. low-resource languages and WEIRD vs. non-WEIRD communities."}

In this paper, we propose a robust TLC (rTLC) method to address the feasibility preservation problem. Specifically, the rTLC method expands the safety function at an order higher than the relative degree of the function using Taylor's expansion with Lagrange remainder, which allows the control to explicitly show up at the current time instead of the future time in the TLC method. The rTLC method naturally addresses the feasibility preservation problem with only one hyper-parameter (the discretization time interval size during implementation), which is much less than its counterparts. Finally, we illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed rTLC method through an adaptive cruise control problem, and compare it with existing safety-critical control methods."}

We observe that many domains -- cloud computing, transportation, power systems -- have differentiable analytical models that prescribe efficient system states. In this work, we propose Descent-Guided Policy Gradient (DG-PG), a framework that constructs noise-free per-agent guidance gradients from these analytical models, decoupling each agent's gradient from the actions of all others. We prove that DG-PG reduces gradient variance from $Θ(N)$ to $\\mathcal{O}(1)$, preserves the equilibria of the cooperative game, and achieves agent-independent sample complexity $\\mathcal{O}(1/ε)$.

We extend this principle to vision-language alignment, showing that isolating and aligning structural cues across modalities can greatly benefit fine-tuning on long, detail-rich captions, with a specific focus on improving cross-modal retrieval. We introduce StructXLIP, a fine-tuning alignment paradigm that extracts edge maps (e.g., Canny), treating them as proxies for the visual structure of an image, and filters the corresponding captions to emphasize structural cues, making them \"structure-centric\". Fine-tuning augments the standard alignment loss with three structure-centric losses: (i) aligning edge maps with structural text, (ii) matching local edge regions to textual chunks, and (iii) connecting edge maps to color images to prevent representation drift. From a theoretical standpoint, while standard CLIP maximizes the mutual information between visual and textual embeddings, StructXLIP additionally maximizes the mutual information between multimodal structural representations. This auxiliary optimization is intrinsically harder, guiding the model toward more robust and semantically stable minima, enhancing vision-language alignment. Beyond outperforming current competitors on cross-modal retrieval in both general and specialized domains, our method serves as a general boosting recipe that can be integrated into future approaches in a plug-and-play manner.

We introduce BarrierSteer, a novel framework that formalizes response safety by embedding learned non-linear safety constraints directly into the model's latent representation space. BarrierSteer employs a steering mechanism based on Control Barrier Functions (CBFs) to efficiently detect and prevent unsafe response trajectories during inference with high precision. By enforcing multiple safety constraints through efficient constraint merging, without modifying the underlying LLM parameters, BarrierSteer preserves the model's original capabilities and performance. We provide theoretical results establishing that applying CBFs in latent space offers a principled and computationally efficient approach to enforcing safety. Our experiments across multiple models and datasets show that BarrierSteer substantially reduces adversarial success rates, decreases unsafe generations, and outperforms existing methods."}

To account for such human behavior, in this paper, we introduce a game-theoretic framework that models the interaction between the population and a public health authority as a signaling game. Individuals (senders) choose how to report their behaviors, while the public health authority (receiver) updates their epidemiological model(s) based on potentially distorted signals. Focusing on deception around masking and vaccination, we characterize analytically game equilibrium outcomes and evaluate the degree to which deception can be tolerated while maintaining epidemic control through policy interventions. Our results show that separating equilibria-with minimal deception-drive infections to near zero over time. Remarkably, even under pervasive dishonesty in pooling equilibria, well-designed sender and receiver strategies can still maintain effective epidemic control. This work advances the understanding of adversarial data in epidemiology and offers tools for designing more robust public health models in the presence of strategic user behavior."}

(Equal contribution: Yasaman Amou Jafari and Mahdi Noori.)", "summary": "With the rise of large language models (LLMs), they have become instrumental in applications such as Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG). Yet evaluating these systems remains bottlenecked by the time and cost of building specialized assessment datasets. We introduce KNIGHT, an LLM-based, knowledge-graph-driven framework for generating multiple-choice question (MCQ) datasets from external sources. KNIGHT constructs a topic-specific knowledge graph, a structured and parsimonious summary of entities and relations, that can be reused to generate instructor-controlled difficulty levels, including multi-hop questions, without repeatedly re-feeding the full source text. This knowledge graph acts as a compressed, reusable state, making question generation a cheap read over the graph. We instantiate KNIGHT on Wikipedia/Wikidata while keeping the framework domain- and ontology-agnostic. As a case study, KNIGHT produces six MCQ datasets in History, Biology, and Mathematics. We evaluate quality on five criteria: fluency, unambiguity (single correct answer), topic relevance, option uniqueness, and answerability given the provided sources (as a proxy for hallucination). Results show that KNIGHT enables token- and cost-efficient generation from a reusable graph representation, achieves high quality across these criteria, and yields model rankings aligned with MMLU-style benchmarks, while supporting topic-specific and difficulty-controlled evaluation."}

AgentOptics interprets natural language tasks and executes protocol-compliant actions on heterogeneous optical devices through a structured tool abstraction layer. We implement 64 standardized MCP tools across 8 representative optical devices and construct a 410-task benchmark to evaluate request understanding, role-aware responses, multi-step coordination, robustness to linguistic variation, and error handling. We assess two deployment configurations--commercial online LLMs and locally hosted open-source LLMs--and compare them with LLM-based code generation baselines. AgentOptics achieves 87.7%--99.0% average task success rates, significantly outperforming code-generation approaches, which reach up to 50% success. We further demonstrate broader applicability through five case studies extending beyond device-level control to system orchestration, monitoring, and closed-loop optimization. These include DWDM link provisioning and coordinated monitoring of coherent 400 GbE and analog radio-over-fiber (ARoF) channels; autonomous characterization and bias optimization of a wideband ARoF link carrying 5G fronthaul traffic; multi-span channel provisioning with launch power optimization; closed-loop fiber polarization stabilization; and distributed acoustic sensing (DAS)-based fiber monitoring with LLM-assisted event detection. These results establish AgentOptics as a scalable, robust paradigm for autonomous control and orchestration of heterogeneous optical systems."}

It unifies predictive performance, intrinsic interpretability, and identifiability, with broad applicability to scientific domains involving optimization. BL parameterizes a compositional utility function built from intrinsically interpretable modular blocks, which induces a data distribution for prediction and generation. Each block represents and can be written in symbolic form as a utility maximization problem (UMP), a foundational paradigm in behavioral science and a universal framework of optimization. BL supports architectures ranging from a single UMP to hierarchical compositions, the latter modeling hierarchical optimization structures. Its smooth and monotone variant (IBL) guarantees identifiability. Theoretically, we establish the universal approximation property of BL, and analyze the M-estimation properties of IBL. Empirically, BL demonstrates strong predictive performance, intrinsic interpretability and scalability to high-dimensional data.

Video reasoning grounds intelligence in spatiotemporally consistent visual environments that go beyond what text can naturally capture, enabling intuitive reasoning over spatiotemporal structure such as continuity, interaction, and causality. However, systematically studying video reasoning and its scaling behavior is hindered by the lack of large-scale training data. To address this gap, we introduce the Very Big Video Reasoning (VBVR) Dataset, an unprecedentedly large-scale resource spanning 200 curated reasoning tasks following a principled taxonomy and over one million video clips, approximately three orders of magnitude larger than existing datasets. We further present VBVR-Bench, a verifiable evaluation framework that moves beyond model-based judging by incorporating rule-based, human-aligned scorers, enabling reproducible and interpretable diagnosis of video reasoning capabilities. Leveraging the VBVR suite, we conduct one of the first large-scale scaling studies of video reasoning and observe early signs of emergent generalization to unseen reasoning tasks. Together, VBVR lays a foundation for the next stage of research in generalizable video reasoning. The data, benchmark toolkit, and models are publicly available at https://video-reason.com/ ."}
