This goal can be achieved using Explainable Reinforcement Learning (XRL) techniques. Although textual explanations are easily understood by humans, ensuring their correctness remains a challenge, and evaluations in state-of-the-art remain limited. We present a novel XRL framework for generating textual explanations, converting them into a set of transparent rules, improving their quality, and evaluating them. Expert's knowledge can be incorporated into this framework, and an automatic predicate generator is also proposed to determine the semantic information of a state. Textual explanations are generated using a Large Language Model (LLM) and a clustering technique to identify frequent conditions. These conditions are then converted into rules to evaluate their properties, fidelity, and performance in the deployed environment. Two refinement techniques are proposed to improve the quality of explanations and reduce conflicting information. Experiments were conducted in three open-source environments to enable reproducibility, and in a telecom use case to evaluate the industrial applicability of the proposed XRL framework. This framework addresses the limitations of an existing method, Autonomous Policy Explanation, and the generated transparent rules can achieve satisfactory performance on certain tasks. This framework also enables a systematic and quantitative evaluation of textual explanations, providing valuable insights for the XRL field."}

Integrating tool calling across multiple LLM providers remains a core engineering challenge due to fragmented APIs, incompatible message formats, and inconsistent streaming and tool-calling behavior, making it difficult to build portable, reliable agent systems. We introduce Orchestral, a lightweight Python framework that provides a unified, type-safe interface for building LLM agents across major providers while preserving the simplicity required for scientific computing and production deployment. Orchestral defines a single universal representation for messages, tools, and LLM usage that operates seamlessly across providers, eliminating manual format translation and reducing framework-induced complexity. Automatic tool schema generation from Python type hints removes the need for handwritten descriptors while maintaining type safety across provider boundaries. A synchronous execution model with streaming support enables deterministic behavior, straightforward debugging, and real-time interaction without introducing server dependencies. The framework's modular architecture cleanly separates provider integration, tool execution, conversation orchestration, and user-facing interfaces, enabling extensibility without architectural entanglement. Orchestral supports advanced agent capabilities found in larger frameworks, including rich tool calling, context compaction, workspace sandboxing, user approval workflows, sub-agents, memory management, and MCP integration."}

To this end, we focus on a task of translating live-stream chat messages and manually construct LiveChatBench, a benchmark consisting of 1,000 Korean-English parallel sentence pairs. Experiments on five mobile devices demonstrate that, although serving a large and heterogeneous user base requires careful consideration of highly constrained deployment settings and model selection, the proposed approach nevertheless achieves performance comparable to commercial models such as GPT-5.1 on the well-targeted task.

We frame infeasibility handling as a preference-aware query repair problem: when a query is unsatisfiable, the agent should relax the least important constraints to the user. We propose three LLM-based methods for inferring relative constraint importance from dialogue: (1) local weighting, (2) global one-shot weighting, and (3) pairwise ranking. Experiments show local weighting achieves the best preference alignment, while global weighting performs best on correct constraint relaxation. We also introduce AWARE-US, a benchmark of persona-grounded queries requiring agents to disambiguate requests via conversation and resolve infeasibility in a way consistent with persona-implied preferences."}

This principle is equally critical in prompt engineering, where designing effective prompts for large language models constitutes a complex optimization challenge. A structured optimization approach requires automated or semi-automated procedures to develop improved prompts, thereby reducing manual effort, improving performance, and yielding an interpretable process. However, current prompt optimization methods often induce prompt drift, where new prompts fix prior failures but impair performance on previously successful tasks. Additionally, generating prompts from scratch can compromise interpretability. To address these limitations, this study proposes the Hierarchical Attribution Prompt Optimization (HAPO) framework, which introduces three innovations: (1) a dynamic attribution mechanism targeting error patterns in training data and prompting history, (2) semantic-unit optimization for editing functional prompt segments, and (3) multimodal-friendly progression supporting both end-to-end LLM and LLM-MLLM workflows.

Moreover, we demonstrate that learning signals can be derived from user simulator behavior in MultiSessionCollab to train agents to generate more comprehensive reflections and update their memory more effectively.

Language relies on problem space search for deep semantic reasoning. While early large language models (LLMs) could generate fluent text, they lacked robust semantic reasoning capabilities.

As a result, improvements in human-like behavior are largely driven by scale or broad supervised training, rather than targeted alignment. We introduce Human Aligning LLMs (HAL), a framework for aligning language models to conversational human-likeness using an interpretable, data-driven reward. HAL derives explicit conversational traits from contrastive dialogue data, combines them into a compact scalar score, and uses this score as a transparent reward signal for alignment with standard preference optimization methods. Using this approach, we align models of varying sizes without affecting their overall performance. In large-scale human evaluations, models aligned with HAL are more frequently perceived as human-like in conversation. Because HAL operates over explicit, interpretable traits, it enables inspection of alignment behavior and diagnosis of unintended effects. More broadly, HAL demonstrates how soft, qualitative properties of language--previously outside the scope for alignment--can be made measurable and aligned in an interpretable and explainable way."}

Using quantum entanglement and superposition principles, the QLSTMA significantly improves the ability to predict complex geological parameters such as permeability. Two quantization structures, QLSTMA with Shared Gates (QLSTMA-SG) and with Independent Gates (QLSTMA-IG), are designed to investigate and evaluate the effects of quantum structure configurations and the number of qubits on model performance. Experimental results demonstrate that the 8-qubit QLSTMA-IG model significantly outperforms the traditional long short-term memory with attention (LSTMA), reducing Mean Absolute Error (MAE) by 19% and Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) by 20%, with particularly strong performance in regions featuring complex well-logging data. These findings validate the potential of quantum-classical hybrid neural networks for reservoir prediction, indicating that increasing the number of qubits yields further accuracy gains despite the reliance on classical simulations.

Partial policies defined for simple domain instances, where high performance is easily attained, are transferred as useful priors to accelerate learning in more complex settings and avoid tuning DRL parameters from scratch. To do so, partial policies are represented as logical rules, and online reasoning is performed to guide the training process through two mechanisms: (i) biasing the action distribution during exploration, and (ii) rescaling Q-values during exploitation. This neuro-symbolic integration enhances interpretability and trustworthiness while accelerating convergence, particularly in sparse-reward environments and tasks with long planning horizons.

Although Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) excel at capturing spatial-temporal dependencies in sensor data, their black-box nature and the limited work on graph-based explainable models for water networks hinder practical adoption. We propose an explainable GNN framework that integrates mutual information to identify critical network regions and fuzzy logic to provide clear, rule-based explanations for node classification tasks. After benchmarking several GNN architectures, we selected the generalized graph convolution network (GENConv) for its superior performance and developed a fuzzy-enhanced variant that offers intuitive explanations for classified leak locations. Our fuzzy graph neural network (FGENConv) achieved Graph F1 scores of 0.889 for detection and 0.814 for localization, slightly below the crisp GENConv 0.938 and 0.858, respectively. Yet it compensates by providing spatially localized, fuzzy rule-based explanations. By striking the right balance between precision and explainability, the proposed fuzzy network could enable hydraulic engineers to validate predicted leak locations, conserve human resources, and optimize maintenance strategies.

Project Bluebird, an industry-academic collaboration, has developed a probabilistic Digital Twin of en route UK airspace as an environment for training and testing AI Air Traffic Control (ATC) agents. There is a developing regulatory landscape for this kind of novel technology. Regulatory requirements are expected to be application specific, and may need to be tailored to each specific use case.\n  We draw on emerging guidance for both Digital Twin development and the use of Artificial Intelligence/Machine Learning (AI/ML) in Air Traffic Management (ATM) to present an assurance framework. This framework defines actionable goals and the evidence required to demonstrate that a Digital Twin accurately represents its physical counterpart and also provides sufficient functionality across target use cases. It provides a structured approach for researchers to assess, understand and document the strengths and limitations of the Digital Twin, whilst also identifying areas where fidelity could be improved. Furthermore, it serves as a foundation for engagement with stakeholders and regulators, supporting discussions around the regulatory needs for future applications, and contributing to the emerging guidance through a concrete, working example of a Digital Twin.\n  The framework leverages a methodology known as Trustworthy and Ethical Assurance (TEA) to develop an assurance case. An assurance case is a nested set of structured arguments that provides justified evidence for how a top-level goal has been realised. In this paper we provide an overview of each structured argument and a number of deep dives which elaborate in more detail upon particular arguments, including the required evidence, assumptions and justifications."}

Our method is based on iterative vector updating: it constructs sparse vectors based on representative texts, and then iteratively refines them through LLM guidance. Our method achieves comparable or superior results to state-of-the-art methods that use contrastive learning, but without assuming prior knowledge of clusters or labels. Experiments on diverse datasets and smaller LLMs show that our method is model agnostic and can be applied to any embedder, with relatively small LLMs, and different clustering methods. We also show that our method scales to large datasets, reducing the computational cost of the LLM.

We analyze two distinct pathways through which AI content can enter RSes: user-centric, in which individuals use AI tools to refine their reviews, and platform-centric, in which platforms generate synthetic reviews directly from structured metadata. Using a large-scale dataset of hotel reviews from TripAdvisor, we generate synthetic reviews using LLMs and evaluate their impact across the training and deployment phases of RSes. We find that AI-generated reviews differ systematically from human-authored reviews across multiple textual dimensions. Although both user- and platform-centric AI reviews enhance RS performance relative to models without textual data, models trained on human reviews consistently achieve superior performance, underscoring the quality of authentic human data. Human-trained models generalize robustly to AI content, whereas AI-trained models underperform on both content types.

We propose an LLM-based recommender (LLM-Rec) that not only predicts items but also generates logically grounded rationales. Our approach leverages a self-annotated rationale dataset and instruction tuning in a rationale-first format, where the model generates an explanation before outputting the recommended item.

Retrieval quality is pivotal, yet failures can arise at several stages: understanding user intent, choosing content types, finding candidates (recall), or ranking results. Meanwhile, sending and processing images is costly, making naive multimodal approaches impractical. We present FUSE: Failure-aware Usage of Subagent Evidence for MultiModal Search and Recommendation. FUSE replaces most raw-image prompting with a compact Grounded Design Representation (GDR): a selection aware JSON of canvas elements (image, text, shape, icon, video, logo), structure, styles, salient colors, and user selection provided by the Planner team. FUSE implements seven context budgeting strategies: comprehensive baseline prompting, context compression, chain-of-thought reasoning, mini-shot optimization, retrieval-augmented context, two-stage processing, and zero-shot minimalism. Finally, a pipeline attribution layer monitors system performance by converting subagent signals into simple checks: intent alignment, content-type/routing sanity, recall health (e.g., zero-hit and top-match strength), and ranking displacement analysis. We evaluate the seven context budgeting variants across 788 evaluation queries from diverse users and design templates (refer Figure 3). Our systematic evaluation reveals that Context Compression achieves optimal performance across all pipeline stages, with 93.3% intent accuracy, 86.8% routing success(with fallbacks), 99.4% recall, and 88.5% NDCG@5.

The classical graph recommendation model utilizes ID embedding to store essential collaborative information. However, this ID-based paradigm faces challenges in transferring to a new domain, making it hard to build a pre-trained graph recommendation model. This phenomenon primarily stems from two inherent challenges: (1) the non-transferability of ID embeddings due to isolated domain-specific ID spaces, and (2) structural incompatibility between heterogeneous interaction graphs across domains.\n  To address these issues, we propose TextBridgeGNN, a pre-training and fine-tuning framework that can effectively transfer knowledge from a pre-trained GNN to downstream tasks. We believe the key lies in how to build the relationship between domains. Specifically, TextBridgeGNN uses text as a semantic bridge to connect domains through multi-level graph propagation. During the pre-training stage, textual information is utilized to break the data islands formed by multiple domains, and hierarchical GNNs are designed to learn both domain-specific and domain-global knowledge with text features, ensuring the retention of collaborative signals and the enhancement of semantics. During the fine-tuning stage, a similarity transfer mechanism is proposed. This mechanism initializes ID embeddings in the target domain by transferring from semantically related nodes, successfully transferring the ID embeddings and graph pattern.\n  Experiments demonstrate that TextBridgeGNN outperforms existing methods in cross-domain, multi-domain, and training-free settings, highlighting its ability to integrate Pre-trained Language Model (PLM)-driven semantics with graph-based collaborative filtering without costly language model fine-tuning or real-time inference overhead."}

Existing governance mechanisms were not designed for these capabilities. Without a way to specify what interactions are and are not allowed, website owners increasingly rely on blanket blocking and CAPTCHAs, which undermine beneficial applications such as efficient automation, convenient use of e-commerce services, and accessibility tools. We introduce agent-permissions.json, a robots.txt-style lightweight manifest where websites specify allowed interactions, complemented by API references where available. This framework provides a low-friction coordination mechanism: website owners only need to write a simple JSON file, while agents can easily parse and automatically implement the manifest's provisions. Website owners can then focus on blocking non-compliant agents, rather than agents as a whole. By extending the spirit of robots.txt to the era of LLM-mediated interaction, and complementing data use initiatives such as AIPref, the manifest establishes a compliance framework that enables beneficial agent interactions while respecting site owners' preferences."}

In this survey, we provide an encyclopedic overview of movement primitive approaches and applications in chronological order. Concretely, we present movement primitive frameworks as a way of representing robotic control trajectories acquired through human demonstrations. Within the area of robotics, movement primitives can encode basic motions at the trajectory level, such as how a robot would grasp a cup or the sequence of motions necessary to toss a ball. Furthermore, movement primitives have been developed with the desirable analytical properties of a spring-damper system, probabilistic coupling of multiple demonstrations, using neural networks in high-dimensional systems, and more, to address difficult challenges in robotics. Although movement primitives have widespread application to a variety of fields, the goal of this survey is to inform practitioners on the use of these frameworks in the context of robotics. Specifically, we aim to (i) present a systematic review of major movement primitive frameworks and examine their strengths and weaknesses; (ii) highlight applications that have successfully made use of movement primitives; and (iii) examine open questions and discuss practical challenges when applying movement primitives in robotics."}

We identify several methodological pitfalls in current AI research on reasoning, including the inability to verify the novelty of findings due to opaque and non-searchable training data, the lack of reproducibility caused by continuous model updates, and the omission of human-interaction transcripts, which obscures the true source of scientific discovery. Additionally, the absence of counterfactuals and data on failed attempts creates a selection bias that may exaggerate LLM capabilities.

Manual navigation of these complex documents is labor-intensive and error-prone, slowing system design, integration, and deployment. To address this challenge, we adopt Contextual Retrieval-Augmented Generation (Contextual RAG), a strategy in which candidate answer choices guide document retrieval and chunk-specific context to improve large language model (LLM) performance. This improvement over traditional RAG achieves more targeted and context-aware retrieval, which improves the relevance of documents passed to the LLM, particularly when the query alone lacks sufficient context for accurate grounding. Our framework is designed for dynamic domains where data evolves rapidly and models must be continuously updated or redeployed, all without requiring LLM fine-tuning. We evaluate this framework using the ORANBenchmark-13K dataset, and compare three LLMs, namely, Llama3.2, Qwen2.5-7B, and Qwen3.0-4B, across both Direct Question Answering (Direct Q&A) and Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting strategies. We show that Contextual RAG consistently improves accuracy over standard RAG and base prompting, while maintaining competitive runtime and CO2 emissions.

Moreover, base station (BS) placement is a crucial task in the network design, where satisfying coverage requirements is essential. To address these, based on our previous work, we first propose a conditional generative adversarial network (cGAN) that predicts location specific received signal strength (RSS), and EMF exposure simultaneously from the network topology, as images. As a network designing application, we propose a Deep Q Network (DQN) framework, using the trained cGAN, for optimal base station (BS) deployment in the network. Compared to conventional ray tracing simulations, the proposed cGAN reduces inference and deployment time from several hours to seconds. Unlike a standalone cGAN, which provides static performance maps, the proposed GAN-DQN framework enables sequential decision making under coverage and exposure constraints, learning effective deployment strategies that directly solve the BS placement problem. Thus making it well suited for real time design and adaptation in dynamic scenarios in order to satisfy pre defined network specific heterogeneous performance goals."}

Existing approaches predominantly aim to infer the diversity of user preferences from observed user feedback. Nonetheless, due to inherent data biases, the observed data may not fully reflect user interests, where underexplored preferences can be overwhelmed or remain unmanifested. Failing to capture these preferences can lead to suboptimal diversity in recommendations. To fill this gap, this work aims to study diversified recommendation from a data-bias perspective. Inspired by the outstanding performance of large language models (LLMs) in zero-shot inference leveraging world knowledge, we propose a novel approach that utilizes LLMs' expertise to uncover underexplored user preferences from observed behavior, ultimately providing diverse and relevant recommendations. To achieve this, we first introduce Tree of Preferences (ToP), an innovative structure constructed to model user preferences from coarse to fine. ToP enables LLMs to systematically reason over the user's rationale behind their behavior, thereby uncovering their underexplored preferences. To guide diversified recommendations using uncovered preferences, we adopt a data-centric approach, identifying candidate items that match user preferences and generating synthetic interactions that reflect underexplored preferences. These interactions are integrated to train a general recommender for diversification. Moreover, we scale up overall efficiency by dynamically selecting influential users during optimization. Extensive evaluations of both diversity and relevance show that our approach outperforms existing methods in most cases and achieves near-optimal performance in others, with reasonable inference latency."}

This forces the encoder to learn high-level latent features of arterial topology without human annotation. Experimental results on clinical CTA datasets demonstrate that initializing the Calcium Removal network with our MAE-based weights significantly improves inpainting accuracy and stenosis estimation compared to training from scratch, specifically in few-shot scenarios."}

By tightly coupling radio sensing with communication functions, ISAC unlocks new capabilities for situational awareness, localization, tracking, and network adaptation. At the same time, the increasing scale, heterogeneity, and dynamics of future wireless systems demand self-organizing network intelligence capable of autonomously managing resources, topology, and services. Artificial intelligence (AI), particularly learning-driven and data-centric methods, has become a key enabler for realizing this vision. This survey provides a comprehensive and system-level review of AI-native ISAC-enabled self-organizing wireless networks. We develop a unified taxonomy that spans: (i) ISAC signal models and sensing modalities, (ii) network state abstraction and perception from sensing-aware radio data, (iii) learning-driven self-organization mechanisms for resource allocation, topology control, and mobility management, and (iv) cross-layer architectures integrating sensing, communication, and network intelligence. We further examine emerging learning paradigms, including deep reinforcement learning, graph-based learning, multi-agent coordination, and federated intelligence that enable autonomous adaptation under uncertainty, mobility, and partial observability. Practical considerations such as sensing-communication trade-offs, scalability, latency, reliability, and security are discussed alongside representative evaluation methodologies and performance metrics. Finally, we identify key open challenges and future research directions toward deployable, trustworthy, and scalable AI-native ISAC systems for 6G and beyond."}

These applications frequently require near real-time responses and low energy consumption on edge devices. Spiking neural networks (SNNs) offer event-driven computation and ultra-low power by exploiting temporal sparsity and multiplication-free computation. Yet existing SNN-based time-series forecasters often inherit complex transformer blocks, thereby losing much of the efficiency benefit. To solve the problem, we propose SpikySpace, a spiking state-space model (SSM) that reduces the quadratic cost in the attention block to linear time via selective scanning. Further, we replace dense SSM updates with sparse spike trains and execute selective scans only on spike events, thereby avoiding dense multiplications while preserving the SSM's structured memory. Because complex operations such as exponentials and divisions are costly on neuromorphic chips, we introduce simplified approximations of SiLU and Softplus to enable a neuromorphic-friendly model architecture. In matched settings, SpikySpace reduces estimated energy consumption by 98.73% and 96.24% compared to two state-of-the-art transformer based approaches, namely iTransformer and iSpikformer, respectively. In standard time series forecasting datasets, SpikySpace delivers competitive accuracy while substantially reducing energy cost and memory traffic. As the first full spiking state-space model, SpikySpace bridges neuromorphic efficiency with modern sequence modeling, marking a practical and scalable path toward efficient time series forecasting systems."}

This feedback loop generates a complex interplay between users, creators, and recommender algorithms, which is the key cause of filter bubbles and opinion polarization. We develop a social network-aware recommender system that explicitly accounts for this user-creators feedback interaction and strategically exploits the topology of the user's own social network to promote diversification. Our approach highlights how accounting for and exploiting user's social network in the recommender system design is crucial to mediate filter bubble effects while balancing content diversity with personalization. Provably, opinion clusterization is positively correlated with the influence of recommended content on user opinions. Ultimately, the proposed approach shows the power of socially-aware recommender systems in combating opinion polarization and clusterization phenomena."}

Therefore, we propose a novel approach called Modality Interaction and Alignment Representation (MIAR). This network integrates contextual features across different modalities using a feature interaction to generate feature tokens to represent global representations of this modality extracting information from other modalities. These four tokens represent global representations of how each modality extracts information from others. MIAR aligns different modalities using contrastive learning and normalization strategies.

Accurately recognizing human emotional states is crucial for facilitating smooth communication between humans and machines. Despite some progress in multimodal sentiment analysis research, numerous challenges remain. The first challenge is the limited and insufficiently rich features extracted from single modality data. Secondly, most studies focus only on the consistency of inter-modal feature information, neglecting the differences between features, resulting in inadequate feature information fusion. In this paper, we first extract multi-channel features to obtain more comprehensive feature information. We employ dual-channel features in both the visual and auditory modalities to enhance intra-modal feature representation. Secondly, we propose a symmetric mutual promotion (SMP) inter-modal feature fusion method. This method combines symmetric cross-modal attention mechanisms and self-attention mechanisms, where the cross-modal attention mechanism captures useful information from other modalities, and the self-attention mechanism models contextual information. This approach promotes the exchange of useful information between modalities, thereby strengthening inter-modal interactions. Furthermore, we integrate intra-modal features and inter-modal fused features, fully leveraging the complementarity of inter-modal feature information while considering feature information differences. Experiments conducted on two benchmark datasets demonstrate the effectiveness and superiority of our proposed method."}

Here, we present the construction of a large-scale, aligned Nanocrystal Synthesis-Property (NSP) database and demonstrate its capability for generative inverse design. To extract structured synthesis routes and their corresponding product properties from literature, we develop NanoExtractor, a large language model (LLM) enhanced by well-designed augmentation strategies. NanoExtractor is validated against human experts, achieving a weighted average score of 88% on the test set, significantly outperforming chemistry-specialized (3%) and general-purpose LLMs (38%). The resulting NSP database contains nearly 160,000 aligned entries and serves as training data for our NanoDesigner, an LLM for inverse synthesis design. The generative capability of NanoDesigner is validated through the successful design of viable synthesis routes for both well-established PbSe nanocrystals and rarely reported MgF2 nanocrystals. Notably, the model recommends a counter-intuitive, non-stoichiometric precursor ratio (1:1) for MgF2 nanocrystals, which is experimentally confirmed as critical for suppressing byproducts. Our work bridges the gap between unstructured literature and data-driven synthesis, and also establishes a powerful human-AI collaborative paradigm for accelerating nanocrystal discovery."}

Pruning has emerged as a promising direction for reducing ViT complexity. However, existing approaches either (i) produce a single pruned model shared across all devices, ignoring device heterogeneity, or (ii) rely on fine-tuning with device-local data, which is often infeasible due to limited on-device resources and strict privacy constraints. As a result, current methods fall short of enabling task-customized ViT pruning in privacy-preserving mobile computing settings. This paper introduces TAP-ViTs, a novel task-adaptive pruning framework that generates device-specific pruned ViT models without requiring access to any raw local data. Specifically, to infer device-level task characteristics under privacy constraints, we propose a Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM)-based metric dataset construction mechanism. Each device fits a lightweight GMM to approximate its private data distribution and uploads only the GMM parameters. Using these parameters, the cloud selects distribution-consistent samples from public data to construct a task-representative metric dataset for each device. Based on this proxy dataset, we further develop a dual-granularity importance evaluation-based pruning strategy that jointly measures composite neuron importance and adaptive layer importance, enabling fine-grained, task-aware pruning tailored to each device's computational budget. Extensive experiments across multiple ViT backbones and datasets demonstrate that TAP-ViTs consistently outperforms state-of-the-art pruning methods under comparable compression ratios."}

Existing multimodal approaches typically fuse Natural Code Sequence (NCS) representations from pretrained language models with Code Property Graph (CPG) representations from graph neural networks, often under the implicit assumption that adding a modality necessarily yields extra information. In practice, sequence and graph representations can be redundant, and fluctuations in the quality of the graph modality can dilute the discriminative signal of the dominant modality. To address this, we propose TaCCS-DFA, a framework that introduces Fisher information as a geometric measure of how sensitive feature directions are to the classification decision, enabling task-oriented complementary fusion. TaCCS-DFA online estimates a low-rank principal Fisher subspace and restricts cross-modal attention to task-sensitive directions, thereby retrieving structural features from CPG that complement the sequence modality; meanwhile, an adaptive gating mechanism dynamically adjusts the contribution of the graph modality for each sample to suppress noise propagation. Our analysis shows that, under an isotropic perturbation assumption, the proposed mechanism admits a tighter risk bound than conventional full-spectrum attention. Experiments on BigVul, Devign, and ReVeal show that TaCCS-DFA achieves strong performance across multiple backbones. With CodeT5 as the backbone, TaCCS-DFA reaches an F1 score of 87.80\\% on the highly imbalanced BigVul dataset, improving over a strong baseline Vul-LMGNNs by 6.3 percentage points while maintaining low calibration error and computational overhead."}

This imbalance skews model training and degrades detection performance, especially for minority instances. To address this issue, we propose a novel importance-weighted loss designed specifically for anomaly detection. Compared to the previous method for LTD in classification, our method does not require prior knowledge of normal data classes. Instead, we introduce a weighted loss function that incorporates importance sampling to align the distribution of anomaly scores with a target Gaussian, ensuring a balanced representation of normal data. Extensive experiments on three benchmark image datasets and three real-world hyperspectral imaging datasets demonstrate the robustness of our approach in mitigating LTD-induced bias.

This work addresses these questions from an information-flow perspective by comparing existing BIQA models with three paradigms designed to learn the image-text-score relationship: Chain-of-Thought, Self-Consistency, and Autoencoder. Our experiments show that the score prediction performance of the existing model significantly drops when only textual information is used for prediction. Whereas the Chain-of-Thought paradigm introduces little improvement in BIQA performance, the Self-Consistency paradigm significantly reduces the gap between image- and text-conditioned predictions, narrowing the PLCC/SRCC difference to 0.02/0.03. The Autoencoder-like paradigm is less effective in closing the image-text gap, yet it reveals a direction for further optimization.

Through systematic ablation studies manipulating the vision encoder, the connector, and the large language model (LLM) across diverse training strategies, we measured each component's contribution to diagnostic accuracy. In our classification task, a trained vision encoder alone could outperform full MLLM pipelines in classification accuracy and fine-tuning the LLM provided no meaningful improvement over prompt-based guidance. And LoRA fine-tuning on a small, class-balanced dataset (500 images) gave better results than training on a much larger but class-imbalanced set (5,778 images), indicating that data balance and quality can matter more than raw scale for this task. These findings suggest that for domain-specific medical classification, LLMs are more effective as interpreters and report generators rather than as primary classifiers.

Recent defenses attempt to prevent unauthorized cloning by embedding protective perturbations into speech to obscure speaker identity while maintaining intelligibility. However, adversaries can apply advanced purification techniques to remove these perturbations, recover authentic acoustic characteristics, and regenerate cloneable voices. Despite the growing realism of such attacks, the robustness of existing defenses under adaptive purification remains insufficiently studied.\n  Most existing purification methods are designed to counter adversarial noise in automatic speech recognition (ASR) systems rather than speaker verification or voice cloning pipelines. As a result, they fail to suppress the fine-grained acoustic cues that define speaker identity and are often ineffective against speaker verification attacks (SVA). To address these limitations, we propose Diffusion-Bridge (VocalBridge), a purification framework that learns a latent mapping from perturbed to clean speech in the EnCodec latent space. Using a time-conditioned 1D U-Net with a cosine noise schedule, the model enables efficient, transcript-free purification while preserving speaker-discriminative structure. We further introduce a Whisper-guided phoneme variant that incorporates lightweight temporal guidance without requiring ground-truth transcripts. Experimental results show that our approach consistently outperforms existing purification methods in recovering cloneable voices from protected speech. Our findings demonstrate the fragility of current perturbation-based defenses and highlight the need for more robust protection mechanisms against evolving voice-cloning and speaker verification threats."}

While fact-checking can mitigate these errors, existing methods typically retrieve external evidence indiscriminately, overlooking the model's internal knowledge and potentially introducing irrelevant noise. Moreover, current systems lack targeted mechanisms to resolve specific uncertainties in the model's reasoning. Inspired by how humans fact-check, we argue that LLMs should adaptively decide whether to rely on internal knowledge or initiate retrieval based on their confidence in a given claim. We introduce Probabilistic Certainty and Consistency (PCC), a framework that estimates factual confidence by jointly modeling an LLM's probabilistic certainty and reasoning consistency. These confidence signals enable an adaptive verification strategy: the model answers directly when confident, triggers targeted retrieval when uncertain or inconsistent, and escalates to deep search when ambiguity is high. Our confidence-guided routing mechanism ensures that retrieval is invoked only when necessary, improving both efficiency and reliability. Extensive experiments across three challenging benchmarks show that PCC achieves better uncertainty quantification than verbalized confidence and consistently outperforms strong LLM-based fact-checking baselines. Furthermore, we demonstrate that PCC generalizes well across various LLMs."}

To address this challenge, we present LAsset, a novel automated framework that leverages large language models (LLMs) to identify security assets from both hardware design specifications and register-transfer level (RTL) descriptions.

However, traces from OS kernels or large-scale applications like Chrome or MySQL are massive and difficult to analyze.

This paper introduces TAAF (Trace Abstraction and Analysis Framework), a novel approach that combines time-indexing, knowledge graphs (KGs), and large language models (LLMs) to transform raw trace data into actionable insights. TAAF constructs a time-indexed KG from trace events to capture relationships among entities such as threads, CPUs, and system resources. An LLM then interprets query-specific subgraphs to answer natural-language questions, reducing the need for manual inspection and deep system expertise. To evaluate TAAF, we introduce TraceQA-100, a benchmark of 100 questions grounded in real kernel traces. Experiments across three LLMs and multiple temporal settings show that TAAF improves answer accuracy by up to 31.2%, particularly in multi-hop and causal reasoning tasks.

Noise correlation, which estimates gradients by correlating perturbations of activity with changes in output, provides a biologically plausible solution to credit assignment but scales poorly as accurately estimating the Jacobian requires that the number of perturbations scale with network size. Moreover, isotropic noise conflicts with neurobiological observations that neural activity lies on a low-dimensional manifold. To address these drawbacks, we propose neural manifold noise correlation (NMNC), which performs credit assignment using perturbations restricted to the neural manifold. We show theoretically and empirically that the Jacobian row space aligns with the neural manifold in trained networks, and that manifold dimensionality scales slowly with network size. NMNC substantially improves performance and sample efficiency over vanilla noise correlation in convolutional networks trained on CIFAR-10, ImageNet-scale models, and recurrent networks. NMNC also yields representations more similar to the primate visual system than vanilla noise correlation. These findings offer a mechanistic hypothesis for how biological circuits could support credit assignment, and suggest that biologically inspired constraints may enable, rather than limit, effective learning at scale."}

Generating them from a single photograph in a controllable manner is particularly challenging. Existing image-animation techniques are restricted to simple, low-frequency motions and operate only in narrow domains with repetitive textures like water and smoke. In contrast, large-scale video diffusion models are not tailored for cinemagraph constraints and lack the specialized data required to generate seamless, controlled loops. We present DreamLoop, a controllable video synthesis framework dedicated to generating cinemagraphs from a single photo without requiring any cinemagraph training data. Our key idea is to adapt a general video diffusion model by training it on two objectives: temporal bridging and motion conditioning. This strategy enables flexible cinemagraph generation. During inference, by using the input image as both the first- and last- frame condition, we enforce a seamless loop. By conditioning on static tracks, we maintain a static background. Finally, by providing a user-specified motion path for a target object, our method provides intuitive control over the animation's trajectory and timing. To our knowledge, DreamLoop is the first method to enable cinemagraph generation for general scenes with flexible and intuitive controls. We demonstrate that our method produces high-quality, complex cinemagraphs that align with user intent, outperforming existing approaches."}

Building on insights from prioritized replay in deep RL, as well as prior observations that rollouts with intermediate success rates tend to produce stronger learning signals under methods such as GRPO, our approach selects problems according to a simple, model-driven priority score derived from empirical success statistics. In contrast to conventional curriculum strategies that emphasize easier tasks early in training, the resulting schedule naturally focuses training on problems that are neither consistently solved nor consistently failed, while deprioritizing those that contribute little gradient information. The method yields a continuously adapting and automatic prioritization process that requires no predefined difficulty tiers, auxiliary predictors, or external labels. We further introduce lightweight mechanisms for practical deployment, including heap-based prioritized sampling and periodic retesting of solved and unsolved problems to mitigate starvation and forgetting. Overall, the approach offers a principled and scalable alternative to manually designed curricula while aligning data selection directly with the dynamics of GRPO-based post-training."}

We argue that the short-term lookahead information available in modern logistics systems is key to mitigating this issue, especially during distribution shifts. We formulate online 3D-BP with lookahead parcels as a Model Predictive Control (MPC) problem and adapt the Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) framework to solve it. Our framework employs a dynamic exploration prior that automatically balances a learned RL policy and a robust random policy based on the lookahead characteristics.

While many believe that LLMs do not memorize much of their training data, recent work shows that substantial amounts of copyrighted text can be extracted from open-weight models. However, it remains an open question if similar extraction is feasible for production LLMs, given the safety measures these systems implement. We investigate this question using a two-phase procedure: (1) an initial probe to test for extraction feasibility, which sometimes uses a Best-of-N (BoN) jailbreak, followed by (2) iterative continuation prompts to attempt to extract the book. We evaluate our procedure on four production LLMs -- Claude 3.7 Sonnet, GPT-4.1, Gemini 2.5 Pro, and Grok 3 -- and we measure extraction success with a score computed from a block-based approximation of longest common substring (nv-recall). With different per-LLM experimental configurations, we were able to extract varying amounts of text. For the Phase 1 probe, it was unnecessary to jailbreak Gemini 2.5 Pro and Grok 3 to extract text (e.g, nv-recall of 76.8% and 70.3%, respectively, for Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone), while it was necessary for Claude 3.7 Sonnet and GPT-4.1. In some cases, jailbroken Claude 3.7 Sonnet outputs entire books near-verbatim (e.g., nv-recall=95.8%). GPT-4.1 requires significantly more BoN attempts (e.g., 20X), and eventually refuses to continue (e.g., nv-recall=4.0%).

A typical example of such attacks is label poisoning, meaning that some agents possess corrupted local labels and share models trained on these poisoned data. To defend against malicious attacks, existing works often focus on designing robust aggregators; meanwhile, the weighted mean aggregator is typically considered a simple, vulnerable baseline. This paper analyzes the robustness of decentralized gradient descent under label poisoning attacks, considering both robust and weighted mean aggregators. Theoretical results reveal that the learning errors of robust aggregators depend on the network topology, whereas the performance of weighted mean aggregator is topology-independent. Remarkably, the weighted mean aggregator, although often considered vulnerable, can outperform robust aggregators under sufficient heterogeneity, particularly when: (i) the global contamination rate (i.e., the fraction of poisoned agents for the entire network) is smaller than the local contamination rate (i.e., the maximal fraction of poisoned neighbors for the regular agents); (ii) the network of regular agents is disconnected; or (iii) the network of regular agents is sparse and the local contamination rate is high. Empirical results support our theoretical findings, highlighting the important role of network topology in the robustness to label poisoning attacks."}

To enable more effective learning with unseen topics of a new corpus without ground-truth labels, we propose CREAM, a self-supervised framework for memory-based continual retrieval.

Existing blockchain-based platforms leverage verifiable credentials but typically lack automated skill-credential generation and the ability to incorporate unstructured evidence of learning. In this paper,a privacy-preserving, AI-enabled decentralized LER system is proposed to address these gaps. Digitally signed transcripts from educational institutions are accepted, and verifiable self-issued skill credentials are derived inside a trusted execution environment (TEE) by a natural language processing pipeline that analyzes formal records (e.g., transcripts, syllabi) and informal artifacts. All verification and job-skill matching are performed inside the enclave with selective disclosure, so raw credentials and private keys remain enclave-confined. Job matching relies solely on attested skill vectors and is invariant to non-skill resume fields, thereby reducing opportunities for screening bias.The NLP component was evaluated on sample learner data; the mapping follows the validated Syllabus-to-O*NET methodology,and a stability test across repeated runs observed <5% variance in top-ranked skills. Formal security statements and proof sketches are provided showing that derived credentials are unforgeable and that sensitive information remains confidential. The proposed system thus supports secure education and employment credentialing, robust transcript verification,and automated, privacy-preserving skill extraction within a decentralized framework."}

With the rising computational cost of training large-scale deep models, dataset distillation has emerged as a promising approach for constructing compact synthetic datasets that retain the knowledge of their large original counterparts. However, traditional optimization-based methods often suffer from high computational overhead, memory constraints, and the generation of unrealistic, noise-like images with limited architectural generalization. Recent non-optimization methods alleviate some of these issues by constructing distilled data from real image patches, but the used rigid patch selection strategies can still discard critical information about the main objects. To solve this problem, we first leverage Grounded SAM2 to identify foreground objects and compute per-image foreground occupancy, from which we derive a category-wise patch decision threshold. Guided by these thresholds, we design a dynamic patch selection strategy that, for each image, either selects the most informative patch from multiple candidates or directly resizes the full image when the foreground dominates. This dual-path mechanism preserves more key information about the main objects while reducing redundant background content. Extensive experiments on multiple benchmarks show that the proposed method consistently improves distillation performance over existing approaches, producing more informative and representative distilled datasets and enhancing robustness across different architectures and image compositions."}

Ensuring system reliability thus demands accurate root cause localization. While many traditional graph-based and deep learning approaches have been explored for this task, they often rely heavily on pre-defined schemas that struggle to adapt to evolving operational contexts. Consequently, a number of LLM-based methods have recently been proposed. However, these methods still face two major limitations: shallow, symptom-centric reasoning that undermines accuracy, and a lack of cross-alert reuse that leads to redundant reasoning and high latency. In this paper, we conduct a comprehensive study of how Site Reliability Engineers (SREs) localize the root causes of failures, drawing insights from professionals across multiple organizations. Our investigation reveals that expert root cause analysis exhibits three key characteristics: recursiveness, multi-dimensional expansion, and cross-modal reasoning. Motivated by these findings, we introduce AMER-RCL, an agentic memory enhanced recursive reasoning framework for root cause localization in microservices. AMER-RCL employs the Recursive Reasoning RCL engine, a multi-agent framework that performs recursive reasoning on each alert to progressively refine candidate causes, while Agentic Memory incrementally accumulates and reuses reasoning from prior alerts within a time window to reduce redundant exploration and lower inference latency. Experimental results demonstrate that AMER-RCL consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods in both localization accuracy and inference efficiency."}

Yet, the intrinsic complexity and dynamic runtime interactions of such systems inevitably give rise to anomalies. Ensuring system reliability therefore hinges on effective root cause analysis (RCA), which entails not only localizing the source of anomalies but also characterizing the underlying failures in a timely and interpretable manner. Recent advances in intelligent RCA techniques, particularly those powered by large language models (LLMs), have demonstrated promising capabilities, as LLMs reduce reliance on handcrafted features while offering cross-platform adaptability, task generalization, and flexibility. However, existing LLM-based methods still suffer from two critical limitations: (a) limited exploration diversity, which undermines accuracy, and (b) heavy dependence on large-scale LLMs, which results in slow inference. To overcome these challenges, we propose SpecRCA, a speculative root cause analysis framework for microservices that adopts a \\textit{hypothesize-then-verify} paradigm. SpecRCA first leverages a hypothesis drafting module to rapidly generate candidate root causes, and then employs a parallel root cause verifier to efficiently validate them. Preliminary experiments on the AIOps 2022 dataset demonstrate that SpecRCA achieves superior accuracy and efficiency compared to existing approaches, highlighting its potential as a practical solution for scalable and interpretable RCA in complex microservice environments."}

We introduce WBC (Window-Based Comparison), which exploits this insight through a sliding window approach with sign-based aggregation. Our method slides windows of varying sizes across text sequences, with each window casting a binary vote on membership based on loss comparisons between target and reference models.

In QGA, we propose to plug a Q-value regularization with double Q-learning strategy into the Decision Transformer backbone. This design enables joint optimization of policy imitation and action-value maximization, allowing the learned bidding policy to both leverage experience from the dataset and alleviate the adverse impact of the suboptimal trajectories.

Given this user heterogeneity, our work explores the novel problem of personalized artwork recommendations according to diverse user preferences. Similar to the multi-dimensional nature of users' tastes, titles contain different themes and tones that may appeal to different viewers. For example, the same title might feature both heartfelt family drama and intense action scenes.

We close this gap with a practical sim-to-real reinforcement learning (RL) framework that utilizes dense tactile feedback combined with joint torque sensing to explicitly regulate physical interactions. To enable effective sim-to-real transfer, we introduce (i) a computationally fast tactile simulation that computes distances between dense virtual tactile units and the object via parallel forward kinematics, providing high-rate, high-resolution touch signals needed by RL; (ii) a current-to-torque calibration that eliminates the need for torque sensors on dexterous hands by mapping motor current to joint torque; and (iii) actuator dynamics modeling to bridge the actuation gaps with randomization of non-ideal effects such as backlash, torque-speed saturation. Using an asymmetric actor-critic PPO pipeline trained entirely in simulation, our policies deploy directly to a five-finger hand. The resulting policies demonstrated two essential skills: (1) command-based, controllable grasp force tracking, and (2) reorientation of objects in the hand, both of which were robustly executed without fine-tuning on the robot.

To address this issue, we propose SEF-DETR, a novel framework that refines query initialization for IRSTD. Specifically, SEF-DETR consists of three components: Frequency-guided Patch Screening (FPS), Dynamic Embedding Enhancement (DEE), and Reliability-Consistency-aware Fusion (RCF). The FPS module leverages the Fourier spectrum of local patches to construct a target-relevant density map, suppressing background-dominated features.

TiMem is characterized by three core properties: (1) temporal--hierarchical organization through TMT; (2) semantic-guided consolidation that enables memory integration across hierarchical levels without fine-tuning; and (3) complexity-aware memory recall that balances precision and efficiency across queries of varying complexity.

We present LongBench Pro, a more realistic and comprehensive bilingual benchmark of 1,500 naturally occurring long-context samples in English and Chinese spanning 11 primary tasks and 25 secondary tasks, with input lengths from 8k to 256k tokens. LongBench Pro supports fine-grained analysis with task-specific metrics and a multi-dimensional taxonomy of context requirement (full vs. partial dependency), length (six levels), and difficulty (four levels calibrated by model performance). To balance quality with scalability, we propose a Human-Model Collaborative Construction pipeline: frontier LLMs draft challenging questions and reference answers, along with design rationales and solution processes, to reduce the cost of expert verification. Experts then rigorously validate correctness and refine problematic cases. Evaluating 46 widely used long-context LLMs on LongBench Pro yields three findings: (1) long-context optimization contributes more to long-context comprehension than parameter scaling; (2) effective context length is typically shorter than the claimed context length, with pronounced cross-lingual misalignment; and (3) the \"thinking\" paradigm helps primarily models trained with native reasoning, while mixed-thinking designs offer a promising Pareto trade-off.

During inference, in order to properly determine the output caption sequence from an arbitrary number of events presented within a video, we introduce an event coherent sampling strategy to select event captions with sufficient coherence across temporal events and cross-modal similarity with the given video.

Existing methods handle all multi-modal data within a single fusion model, overlooking the different needs of the two data types and making it difficult to decouple the conflict between intra-class consistency and inter-modal heterogeneity. To this end, we propose Disentangle Collaboration and Guidance Fusion Representations for Multi-modal Vehicle ReID (DCG-ReID). Specifically, to disentangle heterogeneous quality-distributed modal data without mutual interference, we first design the Dynamic Confidence-based Disentangling Weighting (DCDW) mechanism: dynamically reweighting three-modal contributions via interaction-derived modal confidence to build a disentangled fusion framework. Building on DCDW, we develop two scenario-specific fusion strategies: (1) for balanced quality distributions, Collaboration Fusion Module (CFM) mines pairwise consensus features to capture shared discriminative information and boost intra-class consistency; (2) for unbalanced distributions, Guidance Fusion Module (GFM) implements differential amplification of modal discriminative disparities to reinforce dominant modality advantages, guide auxiliary modalities to mine complementary discriminative info, and mitigate inter-modal divergence to boost multi-modal joint decision performance.

In this work, we introduce PrismVAU, a lightweight yet effective system for real-time VAU that leverages a single off-the-shelf MLLM for anomaly scoring, explanation, and prompt optimization. PrismVAU operates in two complementary stages: (1) a coarse anomaly scoring module that computes frame-level anomaly scores via similarity to textual anchors, and (2) an MLLM-based refinement module that contextualizes anomalies through system and user prompts. Both textual anchors and prompts are optimized with a weakly supervised Automatic Prompt Engineering (APE) framework.

To bridge this gap, we first introduce a hierarchical framework for Auditory Scene Analysis (ASA). Guided by this framework, we introduce a system that enables models like Qwen2-Audio to understand and reason about the complex acoustic world. Our framework achieves this through three core contributions: First, we build a large-scale, synthesized binaural audio dataset to provide the rich spatial cues. Second, we design a hybrid feature projector, which leverages parallel semantic and spatial encoders to extract decoupled representations. These distinct streams are integrated via a dense fusion mechanism, ensuring the model receives a holistic view of the acoustic scene. Finally, we employ a progressive training curriculum, advancing from supervised fine-tuning (SFT) to reinforcement learning via Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO), to explicitly evolve the model's capabilities towards reasoning. On our comprehensive benchmark, the model demonstrates comparatively strong capability for spatial understanding. By enabling this spatial perception, our work provides a clear pathway for leveraging the powerful reasoning abilities of large models towards holistic acoustic scene analysis, advancing from \"mono\" semantic recognition to spatial intelligence."}

Our method employs a contrastive feature retrieval pipeline based on controlled semantic oppositions, combing statistical activation analysis and generation-based validation to distill monosemantic functional features from sparse activation spaces. Using the Big Five personality traits as a case study, we demonstrate that our method enables precise, bidirectional steering of model behavior while maintaining superior stability and performance compared to existing activation steering methods like Contrastive Activation Addition (CAA). We further identify an empirical effect, which we term Functional Faithfulness, whereby intervening on a specific internal feature induces coherent and predictable shifts across multiple linguistic dimensions aligned with the target semantic attribute. Our findings suggest that LLMs internalize deeply integrated representations of high-order concepts, and provide a novel, robust mechanistic path for the regulation of complex AI behaviors."}

Given the strong multi-task generalization ability of ALLMs, we first investigate their performance on all-type ADD under both supervised fine-tuning (SFT) and reinforcement fine-tuning (RFT).

We propose View-Invariant Latent Action (VILA), which models a latent action capturing transition patterns across trajectories to learn view-invariant representations grounded in physical dynamics. VILA aligns these latent actions across viewpoints using an action-guided objective based on ground-truth action sequences. Experiments in both simulation and the real world show that VILA-based policies generalize effectively to unseen viewpoints and transfer well to new tasks, establishing VILA as a strong pretraining framework that improves robustness and downstream learning performance."}

To address these challenges, we propose SentGraph, a sentence-level graph-based RAG framework that explicitly models fine-grained logical relationships between sentences for multi-hop question answering. Specifically, we construct a hierarchical sentence graph offline by first adapting Rhetorical Structure Theory to distinguish nucleus and satellite sentences, and then organizing them into topic-level subgraphs with cross-document entity bridges.

To address this, we introduce Causal Manifold Fairness (CMF), a novel framework that bridges causal inference and geometric deep learning. CMF learns a latent representation where the local Riemannian geometry, defined by the metric tensor and curvature, remains invariant under counterfactual interventions on sensitive attributes. By enforcing constraints on the Jacobian and Hessian of the decoder, CMF ensures that the rules of the latent space (distances and shapes) are preserved across demographic groups. We validate CMF on synthetic Structural Causal Models (SCMs), demonstrating that it effectively disentangles sensitive geometric warping while preserving task utility, offering a rigorous quantification of the fairness-utility trade-off via geometric metrics."}

At the abstract layer, situation calculus models the world and derives weakest preconditions, enabling constraint-aware combinatorial testing to systematically generate diverse, semantically valid world-task configurations with controllable coverage strength.

In these challenging environments, the platform must rely exclusively on inertial sensors, leading to pure inertial navigation. However, the inherent noise and other error terms of the inertial sensors in such real-world scenarios will cause the navigation solution to drift over time. Although conventional deep-learning models have emerged as a possible approach to inertial navigation, they are inherently black-box in nature. Furthermore, they struggle to learn effectively with limited supervised sensor data and often fail to preserve physical principles. To address these limitations, we propose PiDR, a physics-informed inertial dead-reckoning framework for autonomous platforms in situations of pure inertial navigation. PiDR offers transparency by explicitly integrating inertial navigation principles into the network training process through the physics-informed residual component. PiDR plays a crucial role in mitigating abrupt trajectory deviations even under limited or sparse supervision. We evaluated PiDR on real-world datasets collected by a mobile robot and an autonomous underwater vehicle. We obtained more than 29% positioning improvement in both datasets, demonstrating the ability of PiDR to generalize different platforms operating in various environments and dynamics. Thus, PiDR offers a robust, lightweight, yet effective architecture and can be deployed on resource-constrained platforms, enabling real-time pure inertial navigation in adverse scenarios."}

In this paper, we show, both empirically and theoretically, that sparse attention can paradoxically increase end-to-end complexity: information loss often induces significantly longer sequences, a phenomenon we term ``Less is Less'' (Lil). To mitigate the Lil problem, we propose an early-stopping algorithm that detects the threshold where information loss exceeds information gain during sparse decoding.

DFRCP enhances the YOLOv11 feature pyramid by combining large scale and medium scale features while preserving native representations, and by introducing Dynamic Robust Switch units that adaptively inject fuzzy features to strengthen global perception under jitter. Fuzzy features are synthesized by rotating and nonlinearly interpolating multiscale features, then merged through a transparency convolution that learns a content adaptive trade off between original and fuzzy cues. We further develop a CUDA parallel rotation and interpolation kernel that avoids boundary overflow and delivers more than 400 times speedup, making the design practical for edge deployment. We train with paired supervision on a private wheat pest damage dataset of about 3,500 images, augmented threefold using two blur regimes, uniform image wide motion blur and bounding box confined rotational blur. On blurred test sets, YOLOv11 with DFRCP achieves about 10.4 percent higher accuracy than the YOLOv11 baseline with only a modest training time overhead, reducing the need for manual filtering after data collection."}

Although segmentation serves as the foundation for pixel-level understanding, existing approaches face two major challenges. First, they introduce implicit segmentation tokens and require simultaneous fine-tuning of both the MLLM and external pixel decoders, which increases the risk of catastrophic forgetting and limits generalization to out-of-domain scenarios. Second, most methods rely on single-pass reasoning and lack the capability to iteratively refine segmentation results, leading to suboptimal performance. To overcome these limitations, we propose a novel agentic MLLM, named IBISAgent, that reformulates segmentation as a vision-centric, multi-step decision-making process. IBISAgent enables MLLMs to generate interleaved reasoning and text-based click actions, invoke segmentation tools, and produce high-quality masks without architectural modifications. By iteratively performing multi-step visual reasoning on masked image features, IBISAgent naturally supports mask refinement and promotes the development of pixel-level visual reasoning capabilities. We further design a two-stage training framework consisting of cold-start supervised fine-tuning and agentic reinforcement learning with tailored, fine-grained rewards, enhancing the model's robustness in complex medical referring and reasoning segmentation tasks. Extensive experiments demonstrate that IBISAgent consistently outperforms both closed-source and open-source SOTA methods. All datasets, code, and trained models will be released publicly."}

We address this gap diagnostically and propose greedy pruning, a likelihood-preserving deletion procedure that iteratively removes reasoning tokens whose removal minimally degrades model likelihood under a specified objective, yielding length-controlled reasoning chains. We evaluate pruned reasoning in a distillation framework and show that students trained on pruned chains outperform a frontier-model-supervised compression baseline at matched reasoning lengths. Finally, our analysis reveals systematic pruning patterns and shows that attention scores can predict greedy pruning ranks, further suggesting that models encode a nontrivial functional importance structure over reasoning tokens."}

Existing multi-layer fusion methods partially address this limitation but remain static, applying the same layer mixture regardless of the query. In this work, we introduce TGIF (Text-Guided Inter-layer Fusion), a lightweight module that treats encoder layers as depth-wise \"experts\" and predicts a prompt-dependent fusion of visual features. TGIF follows the principle of direct external fusion, requires no vision-encoder updates, and adds minimal overhead. Integrated into LLaVA-1.5-7B, TGIF provides consistent improvements across hallucination, OCR, and VQA benchmarks, while preserving or improving performance on ScienceQA, GQA, and MMBench.

A key challenge in addressing this question is that transformers and brains are trained on fundamentally different data. Brains are initially \"trained\" on prenatal sensory experiences (e.g., retinal waves), whereas transformers are typically trained on large datasets that are not biologically plausible. We reasoned that if transformers learn like brains, then they should develop the same structure as newborn brains when exposed to the same prenatal data. To test this prediction, we simulated prenatal visual input using a retinal wave generator. Then, using self-supervised temporal learning, we trained transformers to adapt to those retinal waves. During training, the transformers spontaneously developed the same structure as newborn visual systems: (1) early layers became sensitive to edges, (2) later layers became sensitive to shapes, and (3) the models developed larger receptive fields across layers. The organization of newborn visual systems emerges spontaneously when transformers adapt to a prenatal visual world. This developmental convergence suggests that brains and transformers learn in common ways and follow the same general fitting principles."}

To address common issues in GAN-based augmentation such as mode collapse and semantic drift, ToxiGAN introduces a two-step directional training strategy and leverages LLM-generated neutral texts as semantic ballast. Unlike prior work that treats LLMs as static generators, our approach dynamically selects neutral exemplars to provide balanced guidance. Toxic samples are explicitly optimized to diverge from these exemplars, reinforcing class-specific contrastive signals. Experiments on four hate speech benchmarks show that ToxiGAN achieves the strongest average performance in both macro-F1 and hate-F1, consistently outperforming traditional and LLM-based augmentation methods.

We argue that closing this gap requires not merely better visual generators, but executable reasoning: decomposing high-level intents into grounded, verifiable plans that directly steer the generative process. To this end, we propose Unified Thinker, a task-agnostic reasoning architecture for general image generation, designed as a unified planning core that can plug into diverse generators and workflows. Unified Thinker decouples a dedicated Thinker from the image Generator, enabling modular upgrades of reasoning without retraining the entire generative model. We further introduce a two-stage training paradigm: we first build a structured planning interface for the Thinker, then apply reinforcement learning to ground its policy in pixel-level feedback, encouraging plans that optimize visual correctness over textual plausibility. Extensive experiments on text-to-image generation and image editing show that Unified Thinker substantially improves image reasoning and generation quality."}

Our model is able to exceed the official passing score when evaluated on the actual exam scale, marking the first demonstration, to our knowledge, of an LLM passing the Japanese bar examination without altering its original question structure or scoring rules. We further conduct extensive comparisons with alternative strategies, including multi-agent inference and decomposition-based supervision, and find that these methods fail to achieve comparable performance. Our results highlight the importance of format-faithful supervision and consistency verification, and suggest that carefully designed single-model approaches can outperform more complex systems in high-stakes professional reasoning tasks. Our dataset and codes are publicly available."}

In particular, decision-makers need to understand what causes generative AI systems to exhibit specific output characteristics. Within this general topic, this paper examines a key question: what is it about the input -- the prompt -- that causes an LLM-based generative AI system to produce output that exhibits specific characteristics, such as toxicity, negative sentiment, or political bias. To examine this question, we adapt a common technique from the Explainable AI literature: counterfactual explanations. We explain why traditional counterfactual explanations cannot be applied directly to generative AI systems, due to several differences in how generative AI systems function. We then propose a flexible framework that adapts counterfactual explanations to non-deterministic, generative AI systems in scenarios where downstream classifiers can reveal key characteristics of their outputs. Based on this framework, we introduce an algorithm for generating prompt-counterfactual explanations (PCEs). Finally, we demonstrate the production of counterfactual explanations for generative AI systems with three case studies, examining different output characteristics (viz., political leaning, toxicity, and sentiment). The case studies further show that PCEs can streamline prompt engineering to suppress undesirable output characteristics and can enhance red-teaming efforts to uncover additional prompts that elicit undesirable outputs. Ultimately, this work lays a foundation for prompt-focused interpretability in generative AI: a capability that will become indispensable as these models are entrusted with higher-stakes tasks and subject to emerging regulatory requirements for transparency and accountability."}

We introduce RATS (Rapid Augmentations for Time Series), a high-performance library for time series augmentation written in Rust with Python bindings (RATSpy). RATS implements multiple augmentation methods spanning basic transformations, frequency-domain operations and time warping techniques, all accessible through a unified pipeline interface with built-in parallelisation. Comprehensive benchmarking of RATSpy versus a commonly used library (tasug) on 143 datasets demonstrates that RATSpy achieves an average speedup of 74.5\\% over tsaug (up to 94.8\\% on large datasets), with up to 47.9\\% less peak memory usage."}

Inspired by these ideas, this work discusses the utilization of FMs, especially multi-modal FMs in wireless networks. We focus on two important types of tasks in wireless network management: prediction tasks and control tasks. In particular, we first discuss FMs-enabled multi-modal contextual information understanding in wireless networks.

To address this gap, we introduce AnatomiX, a multitask multimodal large language model explicitly designed for anatomically grounded chest X-ray interpretation. Inspired by the radiological workflow, AnatomiX adopts a two stage approach: first, it identifies anatomical structures and extracts their features, and then leverages a large language model to perform diverse downstream tasks such as phrase grounding, report generation, visual question answering, and image understanding. Extensive experiments across multiple benchmarks demonstrate that AnatomiX achieves superior anatomical reasoning and delivers over 25% improvement in performance on anatomy grounding, phrase grounding, grounded diagnosis and grounded captioning tasks compared to existing approaches.

We formalize this discrepancy as Conduction Aphasia, a phenomenon where models accurately interpret multimodal inputs but struggle to translate that understanding into faithful and controllable synthesis. To address this, we propose UniCorn, a simple yet elegant self-improvement framework that eliminates the need for external data or teacher supervision. By partitioning a single UMM into three collaborative roles: Proposer, Solver, and Judge, UniCorn generates high-quality interactions via self-play and employs cognitive pattern reconstruction to distill latent understanding into explicit generative signals. To validate the restoration of multimodal coherence, we introduce UniCycle, a cycle-consistency benchmark based on a Text to Image to Text reconstruction loop. Extensive experiments demonstrate that UniCorn achieves comprehensive and substantial improvements over the base model across six general image generation benchmarks. Notably, it achieves SOTA performance on TIIF(73.8), DPG(86.8), CompBench(88.5), and UniCycle while further delivering substantial gains of +5.0 on WISE and +6.5 on OneIG. These results highlight that our method significantly enhances T2I generation while maintaining robust comprehension, demonstrating the scalability of fully self-supervised refinement for unified multimodal intelligence."}

We adopt it in a Datalog-like syntax; we extend normal forms for fixpoint logics to weighted structures; and show an equivalent \"loose\" fixpoint mechanism that allows values of inductively defined weight functions to be overwritten. We propose a \"scalar\" restriction of functional fixpoint logic, of polynomial-time data complexity, and show it can express all PTIME model-agnostic queries over reduced networks with polynomially bounded weights. In contrast, we show that very simple model-agnostic queries are already NP-complete. Finally, we consider transformations of weighted structures by iterated transductions."}

Counterfactual Fairness (CF) audits allow the measurement of bias of ML models with a causal framework, yet their conclusions rely on a single causal graph that is rarely known with certainty in real-world scenarios. We propose CF with Graph Uncertainty (CF-GU), a bias evaluation procedure that incorporates the uncertainty of specifying a causal graph into CF. CF-GU (i) bootstraps a Causal Discovery algorithm under domain knowledge constraints to produce a bag of plausible Directed Acyclic Graphs (DAGs), (ii) quantifies graph uncertainty with the normalized Shannon entropy, and (iii) provides confidence bounds on CF metrics. Experiments on synthetic data show how contrasting domain knowledge assumptions support or refute audits of CF, while experiments on real-world data (COMPAS and Adult datasets) pinpoint well-known biases with high confidence, even when supplied with minimal domain knowledge constraints."}

To resolve this challenge, we propose an efficient approach to fine-tune small language models (SLMs) for accurate relevance labeling, enabling high-throughput, domain-specific labeling comparable or even better in quality to that of state-of-the-art large language models (LLMs). To overcome the lack of high-quality and accessible datasets in the enterprise domain, our method leverages on synthetic data generation. Specifically, we employ an LLM to synthesize realistic enterprise queries from a seed document, apply BM25 to retrieve hard negatives, and use a teacher LLM to assign relevance scores. The resulting dataset is then distilled into an SLM, producing a compact relevance labeler. We evaluate our approach on a high-quality benchmark consisting of 923 enterprise query-document pairs annotated by trained human annotators, and show that the distilled SLM achieves agreement with human judgments on par with or better than the teacher LLM. Furthermore, our fine-tuned labeler substantially improves throughput, achieving 17 times increase while also being 19 times more cost-effective. This approach enables scalable and cost-effective relevance labeling for enterprise-scale retrieval applications, supporting rapid offline evaluation and iteration in real-world settings."}

To address these concerns, this paper develops the Fake Friend Dilemma (FFD), a sociotechnical condition in which users place trust in AI agents that appear supportive while pursuing goals that are misaligned with the user's own. The FFD provides a critical framework for examining how anthropomorphic AI systems facilitate subtle forms of manipulation and exploitation. Drawing on literature in trust, AI alignment, and surveillance capitalism, we construct a typology of harms, including covert advertising, political propaganda, behavioral nudging, and surveillance. We then assess possible mitigation strategies, including both structural and technical interventions. By focusing on trust as a vector of asymmetrical power, the FFD offers a lens for understanding how AI systems may undermine user autonomy while maintaining the appearance of helpfulness."}

To address this gap, we introduce AGL1K, the first audio geo-localization benchmark for audio language models (ALMs), spanning 72 countries and territories. To extract reliably localizable samples from a crowd-sourced platform, we propose the Audio Localizability metric that quantifies the informativeness of each recording, yielding 1,444 curated audio clips. Evaluations on 16 ALMs show that ALMs have emerged with audio geo-localization capability. We find that closed-source models substantially outperform open-source models, and that linguistic clues often dominate as a scaffold for prediction. We further analyze ALMs' reasoning traces, regional bias, error causes, and the interpretability of the localizability metric. Overall, AGL1K establishes a benchmark for audio geo-localization and may advance ALMs with better geospatial reasoning capability."}

Purpose: To create RXL-RADSet, a radiologist-verified synthetic multi-RADS benchmark, and compare validity and accuracy of open-weight small language models (SLMs) with a proprietary model for RADS assignment. Materials and Methods: RXL-RADSet contains 1,600 synthetic radiology reports across 10 RADS (BI-RADS, CAD-RADS, GB-RADS, LI-RADS, Lung-RADS, NI-RADS, O-RADS, PI-RADS, TI-RADS, VI-RADS) and multiple modalities. Reports were generated by LLMs using scenario plans and simulated radiologist styles and underwent two-stage radiologist verification. We evaluated 41 quantized SLMs (12 families, 0.135-32B parameters) and GPT-5.2 under a fixed guided prompt. Primary endpoints were validity and accuracy; a secondary analysis compared guided versus zero-shot prompting. Results: Under guided prompting GPT-5.2 achieved 99.8% validity and 81.1% accuracy (1,600 predictions). Pooled SLMs (65,600 predictions) achieved 96.8% validity and 61.1% accuracy; top SLMs in the 20-32B range reached ~99% validity and mid-to-high 70% accuracy. Performance scaled with model size (inflection between <1B and >=10B) and declined with RADS complexity primarily due to classification difficulty rather than invalid outputs. Guided prompting improved validity (99.2% vs 96.7%) and accuracy (78.5% vs 69.6%) compared with zero-shot. Conclusion: RXL-RADSet provides a radiologist-verified multi-RADS benchmark; large SLMs (20-32B) can approach proprietary-model performance under guided prompting, but gaps remain for higher-complexity schemes."}
