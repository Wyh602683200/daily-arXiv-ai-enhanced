We introduce SAMEP (Secure Agent Memory Exchange Protocol), a\nnovel framework that enables persistent, secure, and semantically searchable\nmemory sharing among AI agents.

SAMEP implements a\ndistributed memory repository with vector-based semantic search, cryptographic\naccess controls (AES-256-GCM), and standardized APIs compatible with existing\nagent communication protocols (MCP, A2A). We demonstrate SAMEP's effectiveness\nacross diverse domains including multi-agent software development, healthcare\nAI with HIPAA compliance, and multi-modal processing pipelines. Experimental\nresults show 73% reduction in redundant computations, 89% improvement in\ncontext relevance scores, and complete compliance with regulatory requirements\nincluding audit trail generation.

The imputation is performed hierarchically, prioritizing the groups\nwith nodes that have the most available neighborhood information. The cluster\nstructure is then used to refine the imputation and correct potential errors.\nFinally, Hop-wise Representation Enhancement (HRE) integrates information\nacross multiple hops, thereby enriching the expressiveness of node\nrepresentations.

However,\nprevailing on-policy RL methods often contend with significant training\ninstability and inefficiency. This is primarily due to a capacity-difficulty\nmismatch, where the complexity of training data frequently outpaces the model's\ncurrent capabilities, leading to critically sparse reward signals and stalled\nlearning progress. This challenge is particularly acute for smaller, more\nresource-efficient LLMs. To overcome this, we introduce the Guided Hybrid\nPolicy Optimization (GHPO), a novel difficulty-aware reinforcement learning\nframework. GHPO dynamically calibrates task difficulty by employing adaptive\nprompt refinement to provide targeted guidance. This unique approach adaptively\nbalances direct imitation learning for problems currently beyond the model's\nreach with exploration-based reinforcement learning for more manageable tasks,\neffectively creating a smooth and optimized learning curriculum. Extensive\nexperiments demonstrate that GHPO achieves an average performance gain of\napproximately 5% across six challenging mathematics benchmarks, consistently\noutperforming strong on-policy reinforcement learning and curriculum learning\nbaselines.

In this study, we proposed a comprehensive framework that combines\nclassification models for heart disease detection and regression models for\nrisk prediction. We employed the Heart Disease dataset, which comprises 1,035\ncases. To address the issue of class imbalance, the Synthetic Minority\nOversampling Technique (SMOTE) was applied, resulting in the generation of an\nadditional 100,000 synthetic data points. Performance metrics, including\naccuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, R2, MSE, RMSE, and MAE, were used to\nevaluate the model's effectiveness. Among the classification models, Random\nForest emerged as the standout performer, achieving an accuracy of 97.2% on\nreal data and 97.6% on synthetic data.

This suppression, referred to as suppressed emotion,\noften stems from well-meaning but value-driven communication, which is\ndifficult to detect or address from outside the family. Focusing on these\nlatent dynamics, this study explores Large Language Model (LLM)-based support\nfor psychologically safe family communication. We constructed a Japanese\nparent-child dialogue corpus of 30 scenarios, each annotated with metadata on\nideal parent bias and suppressed emotion. Based on this corpus, we developed a\nRole-Playing LLM-based multi-agent dialogue support framework that analyzes\ndialogue and generates feedback.

A meta-agent compiles these\noutputs into a structured report, which is then passed to five selected expert\nagents. These agents collaboratively generate empathetic and actionable\nfeedback through a structured four-step discussion process.

Existing methods like U-Net and its variants often\nsuffer from limited global Effective Receptive Fields (ERFs), hindering their\nability to capture long-range dependencies. To address this, we propose U-RWKV,\na novel framework leveraging the Recurrent Weighted Key-Value(RWKV)\narchitecture, which achieves efficient long-range modeling at O(N)\ncomputational cost. The framework introduces two key innovations: the\nDirection-Adaptive RWKV Module(DARM) and the Stage-Adaptive\nSqueeze-and-Excitation Module(SASE). DARM employs Dual-RWKV and QuadScan\nmechanisms to aggregate contextual cues across images, mitigating directional\nbias while preserving global context and maintaining high computational\nefficiency. SASE dynamically adapts its architecture to different feature\nextraction stages, balancing high-resolution detail preservation and semantic\nrelationship capture. Experiments demonstrate that U-RWKV achieves\nstate-of-the-art segmentation performance with high computational efficiency,\noffering a practical solution for democratizing advanced medical imaging\ntechnologies in resource-constrained environments.

However, the impact of\nactivation functions on deep learning (DL) performance in the fNIRS domain\nremains underexplored and lacks systematic investigation in the current\nliterature. This study evaluates a range of conventional and field-specific\nactivation functions for fNIRS classification tasks using multiple deep\nlearning architectures, including the domain-specific fNIRSNet, AbsoluteNet,\nMDNN, and shallowConvNet (as the baseline), all tested on a single dataset\nrecorded during an auditory task. To ensure fair a comparison, all networks\nwere trained and tested using standardized preprocessing and consistent\ntraining parameters. The results show that symmetrical activation functions\nsuch as Tanh and the Absolute value function Abs(x) can outperform commonly\nused functions like the Rectified Linear Unit (ReLU), depending on the\narchitecture. Additionally, a focused analysis of the role of symmetry was\nconducted using a Modified Absolute Function (MAF), with results further\nsupporting the effectiveness of symmetrical activation functions on performance\ngains. These findings underscore the importance of selecting proper activation\nfunctions that align with the signal characteristics of fNIRS data."}

Conventional\ntechniques frequently fail to preserve critical image details, while\ndata-driven approaches exhibit limited generalizability. Implicit Neural\nRepresentations (INRs) present a promising alternative by learning continuous\nmappings from spatial coordinates to pixel intensities for individual images,\nthereby storing network weights rather than raw pixels and avoiding the\ngeneralization problem. However, INR-based compression of large images faces\nchallenges including slow compression speed and suboptimal compression ratios.\nTo address these limitations, we introduce COLI (Compressor for Large Images),\na novel framework leveraging Neural Representations for Videos (NeRV). First,\nrecognizing that INR-based compression constitutes a training process, we\naccelerate its convergence through a pretraining-finetuning paradigm,\nmixed-precision training, and reformulation of the sequential loss into a\nparallelizable objective. Second, capitalizing on INRs' transformation of image\nstorage constraints into weight storage, we implement Hyper-Compression, a\nnovel post-training technique to substantially enhance compression ratios while\nmaintaining minimal output distortion. Evaluations across two medical imaging\ndatasets demonstrate that COLI consistently achieves competitive or superior\nPSNR and SSIM metrics at significantly reduced bits per pixel (bpp), while\naccelerating NeRV training by up to 4 times."}

This paper introduces the Human\nPerception-Based Fuzzy Color Model, COLIBRI (Color Linguistic-Based\nRepresentation and Interpretation), designed to bridge the gap between\ncomputational color representations and human visual perception. The proposed\nmodel uses fuzzy sets and logic to create a framework for color categorization.\nUsing a three-phase experimental approach, the study first identifies\ndistinguishable color stimuli for hue, saturation, and intensity through\npreliminary experiments, followed by a large-scale human categorization survey\ninvolving more than 1000 human subjects. The resulting data are used to extract\nfuzzy partitions and generate membership functions that reflect real-world\nperceptual uncertainty. The model incorporates a mechanism for adaptation that\nallows refinement based on feedback and contextual changes. Comparative\nevaluations demonstrate the model's alignment with human perception compared to\ntraditional color models, such as RGB, HSV, and LAB. To the best of our\nknowledge, no previous research has documented the construction of a model for\ncolor attribute specification based on a sample of this size or a comparable\nsample of the human population (n = 2496).
