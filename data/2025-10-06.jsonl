At the\nsame time, the currently dominant deep learning methods are fundamentally\nblack-box systems that lack explanations for their inferences, significantly\nlimiting their trustworthiness and adoption. Explainable AI (XAI) methods aim\nto overcome this challenge by providing explanations of the models' decision\nprocess. Such methods are often proposed and developed by engineers and\nscientists with a predominantly technical background and incorporate their\nassumptions about the existence, validity, and explanatory utility of different\nconceivable explanatory mechanisms. However, the basic concept of an\nexplanation -- what it is, whether we can know it, whether it is absolute or\nrelative -- is far from trivial and has been the subject of deep philosophical\ndebate for millennia. As we point out here, the assumptions incorporated into\ndifferent XAI methods are not harmless and have important consequences for the\nvalidity and interpretation of AI explanations in different domains. We\ninvestigate ontological and epistemological assumptions in explainability\nmethods when they are applied to AI systems, meaning the assumptions we make\nabout the existence of explanations and our ability to gain knowledge about\nthose explanations. Our analysis shows how seemingly small technical changes to\nan XAI method may correspond to important differences in the underlying\nassumptions about explanations.

While there are some theoretical and primary\nempirical results showing the advantages of latent reasoning with looped\ntransformers or continuous chain-of-thoughts, continuous diffusion models\ntypically underperform their discrete counterparts. In this paper, we argue\nthat diffusion language models do not necessarily need to be in the discrete\nspace. In particular, we prove that continuous diffusion models have stronger\nexpressivity than discrete diffusions and looped transformers. We attribute the\ncontradiction between the theoretical expressiveness and empirical performance\nto their practical trainability: while continuous diffusion provides\nintermediate supervision that looped transformers lack, they introduce\nadditional difficulty decoding tokens into the discrete token space from the\ncontinuous representation space. We therefore propose Coevolutionary Continuous\nDiscrete Diffusion (CCDD), which defines a joint multimodal diffusion process\non the union of a continuous representation space and a discrete token space,\nleveraging a single model to simultaneously denoise in the joint space. By\ncombining two modalities, CCDD is expressive with rich semantics in the latent\nspace, as well as good trainability and sample quality with the help of\nexplicit discrete tokens.

To our\nknowledge, this is one of the first frameworks to leverage the semantic\nembedding capability of the router to dynamically reconfigure the model's\narchitecture during training for substantial efficiency gains. Within each\ncluster, we decompose expert weights into a shared base matrix and extremely\nlow-rank residual adapters, achieving up to fivefold parameter reduction per\ngroup while preserving specialization. This structure enables a two-stage\nhierarchical routing strategy: tokens are first assigned to a cluster, then to\nspecific experts within it, drastically reducing the routing search space and\nthe volume of all-to-all communication. Furthermore, a heterogeneous precision\nscheme, which stores shared bases in FP16 and residual factors in INT4, coupled\nwith dynamic offloading of inactive clusters, reduces peak memory consumption\nto levels comparable to dense models.

Speculative decoding addresses this by\nemploying a fast drafter to propose multi-token drafts, which are then verified\nin parallel by the target model. However, many deployments still rely on AR\ndrafters, where sequential passes limit wall-clock gains. We revisit the\ndrafting stage and present DiffuSpec, a training-free drop-in framework that\nuses a pretrained diffusion language model (DLM) to produce multi-token drafts\nin a single forward pass, while remaining compatible with standard AR\nverifiers. Because DLM drafts are generated under bidirectional conditioning,\nparallel per-position candidates form a token lattice in which the locally\nhighest-probability token at each position need not form a causal left-to-right\npath. Moreover, DLM drafting requires pre-specifying a draft length, inducing a\nspeed-quality trade-off. To address these challenges, we introduce two\npractical components: (i) a causal-consistency path search (CPS) over this\nlattice that extracts a left-to-right path aligned with AR verification; and\n(ii) an adaptive draft-length (ADL) controller that adjusts next proposal size\nbased on recent acceptance feedback and realized generated length. Across\nbenchmarks, DiffuSpec yields up to 3x wall-clock speedup, establishing\ndiffusion-based drafting as a robust alternative to autoregressive drafters for\nspeculative decoding."}

Specifically, we target\nthe representations of DETR-style object queries and propose a simple,\ndetector-agnostic framework to align them with modality context. First, we\ndefine modality tokens: compact, text-derived embeddings encoding imaging\nmodality that are lightweight and require no extra annotations.

While prior work demonstrated the\neffectiveness of NPDs on synthetic channels, this study extends the NPD to\nreal-world communication systems. The NPD was adapted to complete OFDM and\nsingle-carrier communication systems. To satisfy practical system requirements,\nthe NPD is extended to support any code length via rate matching, higher-order\nmodulations, and robustness across diverse channel conditions. The NPD operates\ndirectly on channels with memory, exploiting their structure to achieve higher\ndata rates without requiring pilots and a cyclic prefix. Although NPD entails\nhigher computational complexity than the standard 5G polar decoder, its neural\nnetwork architecture enables an efficient representation of channel statistics,\nresulting in manageable complexity suitable for practical systems. Experimental\nresults over 5G channels demonstrate that the NPD consistently outperforms the\n5G polar decoder in terms of BER, BLER, and throughput. These improvements are\nparticularly significant for low-rate and short-block configurations, which are\nprevalent in 5G control channels. Furthermore, NPDs applied to single-carrier\nsystems offer performance comparable to OFDM with lower PAPR, enabling\neffective single-carrier transmission over 5G channels. These results position\nthe NPD as a high-performance, pilotless, and robust decoding solution."}
