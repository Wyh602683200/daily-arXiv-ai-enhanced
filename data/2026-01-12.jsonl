Existing methods often address isolated sub-problems such as cyanobacteria, chlorophyll, or other quality indicators separately. NAIAD introduces an agentic AI assistant that leverages Large Language Models (LLMs) and external analytical tools to deliver a holistic solution for inland water monitoring using Earth Observation (EO) data. Designed for both experts and non-experts, NAIAD provides a single-prompt interface that translates natural-language queries into actionable insights. Through Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), LLM reasoning, external tool orchestration, computational graph execution, and agentic reflection, it retrieves and synthesizes knowledge from curated sources to produce tailored reports. The system integrates diverse tools for weather data, Sentinel-2 imagery, remote-sensing index computation (e.g., NDCI), chlorophyll-a estimation, and established platforms such as CyFi. Performance is evaluated using correctness and relevancy metrics, achieving over 77% and 85% respectively on a dedicated benchmark covering multiple user-expertise levels. Preliminary results show strong adaptability and robustness across query types. An ablation study on LLM backbones further highlights Gemma 3 (27B) and Qwen 2.5 (14B) as offering the best balance between computational efficiency and reasoning performance."}

In this study, we propose an ontology-guided, equation-centric framework that tightly integrates large language models (LLMs) with an additive manufacturing mathematical knowledge graph (AM-MKG) to enable reliable knowledge extraction and principled extrapolative modeling. By explicitly encoding equations, variables, assumptions, and their semantic relationships within a formal ontology, unstructured literature is transformed into machine-interpretable representations that support structured querying and reasoning. LLM-based equation generation is further conditioned on MKG-derived subgraphs, enforcing physically meaningful functional forms and mitigating non-physical or unstable extrapolation trends. To assess reliability beyond conventional predictive uncertainty, a confidence-aware extrapolation assessment is introduced, integrating extrapolation distance, statistical stability, and knowledge-graph-based physical consistency into a unified confidence score. Results demonstrate that ontology-guided extraction significantly improves the structural coherence and quantitative reliability of extracted knowledge, while subgraph-conditioned equation generation yields stable and physically consistent extrapolations compared to unguided LLM outputs. Overall, this work establishes a unified pipeline for ontology-driven knowledge representation, equation-centered reasoning, and confidence-based extrapolation assessment, highlighting the potential of knowledge-graph-augmented LLMs as reliable tools for extrapolative modeling in additive manufacturing."}

Although recent studies suggest that assigning personality traits to LLMs can influence their behavior, how personality steering affects cooperation under controlled conditions remains unclear. In this study, we examine the effects of personality steering on cooperative behavior in LLM agents using repeated Prisoner's Dilemma games. Based on the Big Five framework, we first measure basic personality profiles of three models, GPT-3.5-turbo, GPT-4o, and GPT-5, using the Big Five Inventory. We then compare behavior under baseline and personality-informed conditions, and further analyze the effects of independently manipulating each personality dimension to extreme values. Our results show that agreeableness is the dominant factor promoting cooperation across all models, while other personality traits have limited impact. Explicit personality information increases cooperation but can also raise vulnerability to exploitation, particularly in earlier-generation models. In contrast, later-generation models exhibit more selective cooperation. These findings indicate that personality steering acts as a behavioral bias rather than a deterministic control mechanism."}

While existing methods could leverage databases of expert-curated enzyme-substrate pairs for models to learn from known pair interactions, the databases are often sparse, i.e., there are only limited and incomplete examples of such pairs, and also labor-intensive to maintain. This lack of sufficient training data significantly hinders the ability of traditional enzyme prediction models to generalize to unseen interactions. In this work, we try to exploit chemical reaction equations from domain-specific databases, given their easier accessibility and denser, more abundant data. However, interactions of multiple compounds, e.g., educts and products, with the same enzymes create complex relational data patterns that traditional models cannot easily capture. To tackle that, we represent chemical reaction equations as triples of (educt, enzyme, product) within a knowledge graph, such that we can take advantage of knowledge graph embedding (KGE) to infer missing enzyme-substrate pairs for graph completion. Particularly, in order to capture intricate relationships among compounds, we propose our knowledge-enhanced hypergraph model for enzyme prediction, i.e., Hyper-Enz, which integrates a hypergraph transformer with a KGE model to learn representations of the hyper-edges that involve multiple educts and products. Also, a multi-expert paradigm is introduced to guide the learning of enzyme-substrate interactions with both the proposed model and chemical reaction equations. Experimental results show a significant improvement, with up to a 88% relative improvement in average enzyme retrieval accuracy and 30% improvement in pair-level prediction compared to traditional models, demonstrating the effectiveness of our approach."}

This study examines conformity, the tendency to align with group opinions under social pressure, in large multimodal language models functioning as AI agents. By adapting classic visual experiments from social psychology, we investigate how AI agents respond to group influence as social actors. Our experiments reveal that AI agents exhibit a systematic conformity bias, aligned with Social Impact Theory, showing sensitivity to group size, unanimity, task difficulty, and source characteristics. Critically, AI agents achieving near-perfect performance in isolation become highly susceptible to manipulation through social influence. This vulnerability persists across model scales: while larger models show reduced conformity on simple tasks due to improved capabilities, they remain vulnerable when operating at their competence boundary. These findings reveal fundamental security vulnerabilities in AI agent decision-making that could enable malicious manipulation, misinformation campaigns, and bias propagation in multi-agent systems, highlighting the urgent need for safeguards in collective AI deployments."}

The process begins with a root claim, which branches into supporting and attacking child arguments. An argument's strength is determined bottom-up via a pairwise tournament of its children, adjudicated by a judge LLM, allowing a final, transparent and contestable verdict to be systematically derived which is missing in methods like Chain-of-Thought (CoT).

Recent research employs reinforcement learning (RL) to end-to-end optimize the retrieval-augmented reasoning process, directly enhancing its capacity to resolve complex queries. However, reliable deployment is hindered by two obstacles. 1) Retrieval Collapse: iterative retrieval over large corpora fails to locate intermediate evidence containing bridge answers without reasoning-guided planning, causing downstream reasoning to collapse. 2) Learning Instability: end-to-end trajectory training suffers from weak credit assignment across reasoning chains and poor error localization across modules, causing overfitting to benchmark-specific heuristics that limit transferability and stability. To address these problems, we propose PRISMA, a decoupled RL-guided framework featuring a Plan-Retrieve-Inspect-Solve-Memoize architecture. PRISMA's strength lies in reasoning-guided collaboration: the Inspector provides reasoning-based feedback to refine the Planner's decomposition and fine-grained retrieval, while enforcing evidence-grounded reasoning in the Solver. We optimize individual agent capabilities via Two-Stage Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO). Stage I calibrates the Planner and Solver as specialized experts in planning and reasoning, while Stage II utilizes Observation-Aware Residual Policy Optimization (OARPO) to enhance the Inspector's ability to verify context and trigger targeted recovery.

This ambiguity is particularly consequential in medicine where uncertainty is pervasive. In this paper, we introduce a probabilistic paradigm to theoretically explain how high certainty in ground truth answers is almost always necessary for even an expert to achieve high scores, whereas in datasets with high variation in ground truth answers there may be little difference between a random labeller and an expert. Therefore, ignoring uncertainty in ground truth evaluation data can result in the misleading conclusion that a non-expert has similar performance to that of an expert. Using the probabilistic paradigm, we thus bring forth the concepts of expected accuracy and expected F1 to estimate the score an expert human or system can achieve given ground truth answer variability.\n  Our work leads to the recommendation that when establishing the capability of a system, results should be stratified by probability of the ground truth answer, typically measured by the agreement rate of ground truth experts. Stratification becomes critical when the overall performance drops below a threshold of 80%. Under stratified evaluation, performance comparison becomes more reliable in high certainty bins, mitigating the effect of the key confounding factor -- uncertainty."}

As Large Language Models (LLMs) become integral to robotics decision-making, the physical dimension of risk grows; a single wrong instruction can directly endanger human safety. This paper addresses the urgent need to systematically evaluate LLM performance in scenarios where even minor errors are catastrophic. Through a qualitative evaluation of a fire evacuation scenario, we identified critical failure cases in LLM-based decision-making. Based on these, we designed seven tasks for quantitative assessment, categorized into: Complete Information, Incomplete Information, and Safety-Oriented Spatial Reasoning (SOSR). Complete information tasks utilize ASCII maps to minimize interpretation ambiguity and isolate spatial reasoning from visual processing. Incomplete information tasks require models to infer missing context, testing for spatial continuity versus hallucinations. SOSR tasks use natural language to evaluate safe decision-making in life-threatening contexts. We benchmark various LLMs and Vision-Language Models (VLMs) across these tasks. Beyond aggregate performance, we analyze the implications of a 1% failure rate, highlighting how \"rare\" errors escalate into catastrophic outcomes. Results reveal serious vulnerabilities: several models achieved a 0% success rate in ASCII navigation, while in a simulated fire drill, models instructed robots to move toward hazardous areas instead of emergency exits. Our findings lead to a sobering conclusion: current LLMs are not ready for direct deployment in safety-critical systems. A 99% accuracy rate is dangerously misleading in robotics, as it implies one out of every hundred executions could result in catastrophic harm. We demonstrate that even state-of-the-art models cannot guarantee safety, and absolute reliance on them creates unacceptable risks."}

To bridge this gap between conventional machine learning limitations and the untapped potential of LLMs in fraud detection, this paper proposes a novel approach that employs Reinforcement Learning (RL) to post-train lightweight language models specifically for fraud detection tasks using only raw transaction data. We utilize the Group Sequence Policy Optimization (GSPO) algorithm combined with a rule-based reward system to fine-tune language models of various sizes on a real-life transaction dataset provided by a Chinese global payment solution company. Through this reinforcement learning framework, the language models are encouraged to explore diverse trust and risk signals embedded within the textual transaction data, including patterns in customer information, shipping details, product descriptions, and order history. Our experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of this approach, with post-trained language models achieving substantial F1-score improvements on held-out test data.

Without explicitly modeling these biases, the true relevance of ranked items cannot be correctly learned from clicks. Existing Unbiased Learning-to-Rank (ULTR) methods mainly correct position bias and rely on propensity estimation, but they cannot measure remaining bias, provide risk guarantees, or jointly handle multiple bias sources. To overcome these challenges, this paper introduces a novel causal learning-based ranking framework that extends ULTR by combining Structural Causal Models (SCMs) with information-theoretic tools. SCMs specify how clicks are generated and help identify the true relevance signal from click data, while conditional mutual information, measures how much bias leaks into the\n  learned relevance estimates. We use this leakage measure to define a rigorous notion of disentanglement and include it as a regularizer during model training to reduce bias. In addition, we incorporate a causal inference estimator, i.e., doubly robust estimator, to ensure more reliable risk estimation.

To address these challenges, this paper proposes the Cumulative Path-Level Semantic Reasoning for inductive knowledge graph completion (CPSR) framework, which simultaneously captures both the structural and semantic information of KGs to enhance the inductive KGC task.

Framing human-model interaction as a control process, we propose a novel algorithm to estimate the controllable sets of models in a dialogue setting. Notably, we provide formal guarantees on the estimation error as a function of sample complexity: we derive probably-approximately correct bounds for controllable set estimates that are distribution-free, employ no assumptions except for output boundedness, and work for any black-box nonlinear control system (i.e., any generative model). We empirically demonstrate the theoretical framework on different tasks in controlling dialogue processes, for both language models and text-to-image generation. Our results show that model controllability is surprisingly fragile and highly dependent on the experimental setting. This highlights the need for rigorous controllability analysis, shifting the focus from simply attempting control to first understanding its fundamental limits."}

To address this challenge, we view the hybrid action space problem as a fully cooperative game and propose a \\textbf{Cooperative Hybrid Diffusion Policies (CHDP)} framework to solve it. CHDP employs two cooperative agents that leverage a discrete and a continuous diffusion policy, respectively. The continuous policy is conditioned on the discrete action's representation, explicitly modeling the dependency between them. This cooperative design allows the diffusion policies to leverage their expressiveness to capture complex distributions in their respective action spaces. To mitigate the update conflicts arising from simultaneous policy updates in this cooperative setting, we employ a sequential update scheme that fosters co-adaptation. Moreover, to improve scalability when learning in high-dimensional discrete action space, we construct a codebook that embeds the action space into a low-dimensional latent space. This mapping enables the discrete policy to learn in a compact, structured space. Finally, we design a Q-function-based guidance mechanism to align the codebook's embeddings with the discrete policy's representation during training. On challenging hybrid action benchmarks, CHDP outperforms the state-of-the-art method by up to $19.3\\%$ in success rate."}

In this paper, we identify a distinct failure mode termed Circular Reasoning. Unlike traditional model degeneration, this phenomenon manifests as a self-reinforcing trap where generated content acts as a logical premise for its own recurrence, compelling the reiteration of preceding text. To systematically analyze this phenomenon, we introduce LoopBench, a dataset designed to capture two distinct loop typologies: numerical loops and statement loops. Mechanistically, we characterize circular reasoning as a state collapse exhibiting distinct boundaries, where semantic repetition precedes textual repetition. We reveal that reasoning impasses trigger the loop onset, which subsequently persists as an inescapable cycle driven by a self-reinforcing V-shaped attention mechanism. Guided by these findings, we employ the Cumulative Sum (CUSUM) algorithm to capture these precursors for early loop prediction. Experiments across diverse LRMs validate its accuracy and elucidate the stability of long-chain reasoning."}

We propose a logic-parametric framework for neuro-symbolic NLI that treats the underlying logic not as a static background, but as a controllable component. Using the LogiKEy methodology, we embed a range of classical and non-classical formalisms into higher-order logic (HOL), enabling a systematic comparison of inference quality, explanation refinement, and proof behavior. We focus on normative reasoning, where the choice of logic has significant implications. In particular, we compare logic-external approaches, where normative requirements are encoded via axioms, with logic-internal approaches, where normative patterns emerge from the logic's built-in structure. Extensive experiments demonstrate that logic-internal strategies can consistently improve performance and produce more efficient hybrid proofs for NLI. In addition, we show that the effectiveness of a logic is domain-dependent, with first-order logic favouring commonsense reasoning, while deontic and modal logics excel in ethical domains. Our results highlight the value of making logic a first-class, parametric element in neuro-symbolic architectures for more robust, modular, and adaptable reasoning."}

In this work, we propose Hierarchical Speculative Decoding (HSD), a provably lossless verification method that significantly boosts the expected number of accepted tokens and overcomes joint intractability by balancing excess and deficient probability mass across accessible branches. Our extensive large-scale experiments demonstrate that HSD yields consistent improvements in acceptance rates across diverse model families and benchmarks. Moreover, its strong explainability and generality make it readily integrable into a wide range of speculative decoding frameworks. Notably, integrating HSD into EAGLE-3 yields over a 12% performance gain, establishing state-of-the-art decoding efficiency without compromising distribution fidelity.

The benchmark stratifies 200 subjects into four visibility categories: high, medium, low, and zero--based on the extent and nature of their information available online. We evaluate 18 open-source VLMs (0.3B-32B) based on two key metrics: percentage of PII probing queries refused (Refusal Rate) and the fraction of non-refusal responses flagged for containing PII (Conditional PII Disclosure Rate). Across models, we observe a consistent pattern: refusals increase and PII disclosures decrease (9.10% high to 5.34% low) as subject visibility drops. We identify that models are more likely to disclose PII for high-visibility subjects, alongside substantial model-family heterogeneity and PII-type disparities. Finally, paraphrasing and jailbreak-style prompts expose attack and model-dependent failures, motivating visibility-aware safety evaluation and training interventions."}

Recently, researchers have further investigated Multi-Agent Debate (MAD) frameworks, which enhance the reasoning and collaboration capabilities of MAS through information exchange and debate among multiple agents. However, existing approaches often rely on unguided initialization, causing agents to adopt identical reasoning paths that lead to the same errors. As a result, effective debate among agents is hindered, and the final outcome frequently degenerates into simple majority voting. To solve the above problem, in this paper, we introduce Dynamic Multi-Agent Debate (DynaDebate), which enhances the effectiveness of multi-agent debate through three key mechanisms: (1) Dynamic Path Generation and Allocation, which employs a dedicated Path Generation Agent to generate diverse and logical solution paths with adaptive redundancy; (2) Process-Centric Debate, which shifts the focus from surface-level outcome voting to rigorous step-by-step logic critique to ensure process correctness; (3) A Trigger-Based Verification Agent, which is activated upon disagreement and uses external tools to objectively resolve deadlocks. Extensive experiments demonstrate that DynaDebate achieves superior performance across various benchmarks, surpassing existing state-of-the-art MAD methods."}

Top-performing CUAs are framework-based systems that decompose planning and execution, while end-to-end screenshot-to-action policies are easier to deploy but lag behind on benchmarks such as OSWorld-Verified. GUI datasets like OSWorld pose two bottlenecks: they expose only a few hundred interactive, verifiable tasks and environments, and expert trajectories must be gathered by interacting with these environments, making such data hard to scale. We therefore ask how reinforcement learning from verifiable rewards (RLVR) can best exploit a small pool of exist expert trajectories to train end-to-end policies. Naively mixing these off-policy traces into on-policy RLVR is brittle: even after format conversion, expert trajectories exhibit structural mismatch and distribution shift from the learner. We propose BEPA (Bi-Level Expert-to-Policy Assimilation), which turns static expert traces into policy-aligned guidance via self-rolled reachable trajectories under the base policy (LEVEL-1) and a per-task, dynamically updated cache used in RLVR (LEVEL-2). On OSWorld-Verified, BEPA improves UITARS1.5-7B success from 22.87% to 32.13% and raises a held-out split from 5.74% to 10.30%, with consistent gains on MMBench-GUI and Online-Mind2Web.

To address both task-level memory inefficiency and the inability to reuse coordination experience, we propose StackPlanner, a hierarchical multi-agent framework with explicit memory control. StackPlanner addresses these challenges by decoupling high-level coordination from subtask execution with active task-level memory control, and by learning to retrieve and exploit reusable coordination experience via structured experience memory and reinforcement learning. Experiments on multiple deep-search and agent system benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach in enabling reliable long-horizon multi-agent collaboration."}

Real-time strategy (RTS) games serve as an ideal testbed for evaluating these two capabilities, as their inherent gameplay requires both macro-level strategic planning and micro-level tactical adaptation and action execution. Existing RTS game-based environments either suffer from relatively high computational demands or lack support for textual observations, which has constrained the use of RTS games for LLM evaluation. Motivated by this, we present TowerMind, a novel environment grounded in the tower defense (TD) subgenre of RTS games. TowerMind preserves the key evaluation strengths of RTS games for assessing LLMs, while featuring low computational demands and a multimodal observation space, including pixel-based, textual, and structured game-state representations. In addition, TowerMind supports the evaluation of model hallucination and provides a high degree of customizability. We design five benchmark levels to evaluate several widely used LLMs under different multimodal input settings. The results reveal a clear performance gap between LLMs and human experts across both capability and hallucination dimensions. The experiments further highlight key limitations in LLM behavior, such as inadequate planning validation, a lack of multifinality in decision-making, and inefficient action use. We also evaluate two classic reinforcement learning algorithms: Ape-X DQN and PPO. By offering a lightweight and multimodal design, TowerMind complements the existing RTS game-based environment landscape and introduces a new benchmark for the AI agent field.

To support this research, we build Ambi3D, the large-scale benchmark for this task, featuring over 700 diverse 3D scenes and around 22k instructions.

While various approaches have emerged for this task, they face inherent trade-offs: rule-based methods often struggle to satisfy code safety and idiomaticity requirements, while LLM-based methods frequently fail to generate semantically equivalent Rust code, due to the heavy dependencies of modules across the entire codebase. Recent studies have revealed that both solutions are limited to small-scale programs. In this paper, we propose EvoC2Rust, an automated framework for converting complete C projects to equivalent Rust ones. EvoC2Rust employs a skeleton-guided translation strategy for project-level translation. The pipeline consists of three stages: 1) it first decomposes the C project into functional modules, employs a feature-mapping-enhanced LLM to transform definitions and macros, and generates type-checked function stubs, which form a compilable Rust skeleton; 2) it then incrementally translates functions, replacing the corresponding stub placeholders; 3) finally, it repairs compilation errors by integrating LLM and static analysis. Through evolutionary augmentation, EvoC2Rust combines the advantages of both rule-based and LLM-based solutions. Our evaluation on open-source benchmarks and six industrial projects demonstrates the superior performance of EvoC2Rust in project-level C-to-Rust translation. The results show that our approach outperforms the strongest LLM-based baseline by 17.24% in syntax accuracy and 14.32% in semantic accuracy, while also achieving a 43.59% higher code safety rate than the best rule-based tool."}

In this work, we address this limitation by introducing a more realistic probabilistic framework, `(k, $\\varepsilon$)-unstable,' to certify defenses against diverse jailbreaking attacks, from gradient-based (GCG) to semantic (PAIR). We derive a new, data-informed lower bound on SmoothLLM's defense probability by incorporating empirical models of attack success, providing a more trustworthy and practical safety certificate. By introducing the notion of (k, $\\varepsilon$)-unstable, our framework provides practitioners with actionable safety guarantees, enabling them to set certification thresholds that better reflect the real-world behavior of LLMs. Ultimately, this work contributes a practical and theoretically-grounded mechanism to make LLMs more resistant to the exploitation of their safety alignments, a critical challenge in secure AI deployment."}

This paper introduces a novel, automated pipeline for generating large-scale, psychologically-grounded multi-turn jailbreak datasets. We systematically operationalize FITD techniques into reproducible templates, creating a benchmark of 1,500 scenarios across illegal activities and offensive content. We evaluate seven models from three major LLM families under both multi-turn (with history) and single-turn (without history) conditions. Our results reveal stark differences in contextual robustness: models in the GPT family demonstrate a significant vulnerability to conversational history, with Attack Success Rates (ASR) increasing by as much as 32 percentage points. In contrast, Google's Gemini 2.5 Flash exhibits exceptional resilience, proving nearly immune to these attacks, while Anthropic's Claude 3 Haiku shows strong but imperfect resistance. These findings highlight a critical divergence in how current safety architectures handle conversational context and underscore the need for defenses that can resist narrative-based manipulation."}

The original work reports strong performance and suggests that recursive latent updates enable non-trivial reasoning, but it remains unclear how much of this performance stems from architecture, test-time compute, or task-specific priors. In this technical note, we empirically analyze the ARC Prize TRM checkpoint on ARC-AGI-1 and report four behavioral findings and an efficiency comparison. First, we show that test-time augmentation and majority-vote ensembling account for a substantial fraction of reported performance: the 1000-sample voting pipeline improves Pass@1 by about 11 percentage points over single-pass canonical inference. Second, a puzzle-identity ablation reveals strict dependence on task identifiers: replacing the correct puzzle ID with a blank or random token yields zero accuracy. Third, a recursion trajectory analysis shows that most of the final accuracy is achieved at the first recursion step and that performance saturates after few latent updates, indicating shallow effective recursion. Fourth, early-stage training experiments under canonical versus heavy augmentation regimes suggest that heavy augmentation broadens the distribution of candidate solutions and improves multi-sample success. Finally, we compare TRM with a naive QLoRA fine-tune of Llama 3 8B on canonical ARC-AGI-1, finding that TRM's non-autoregressive design achieves much higher throughput and substantially lower memory usage in this setting. Overall, TRM's ARC-AGI-1 performance appears to arise from an interaction between efficiency, task-specific conditioning, and aggressive test-time compute rather than deep internal reasoning."}

SP-Rank contains over 12,000 human-generated datapoints across three domains -- geography, movies, and paintings, and spans nine elicitation formats with varying subset sizes. This structure enables empirical analysis of preference aggregation when expert identities are unknown but presumed to exist, and individual votes represent noisy estimates of a shared ground-truth ranking. We benchmark SP-Rank by comparing traditional aggregation methods that use only first-order votes against SP-Voting, a second-order method that jointly reasons over both signals to infer ground-truth rankings. While SP-Rank also supports models that rely solely on second-order predictions, our benchmarks emphasize the gains from combining both signals. We evaluate performance across three core tasks: (1) full ground-truth rank recovery, (2) subset-level rank recovery, and (3) probabilistic modeling of voter behavior. Results show that incorporating second-order signals substantially improves accuracy over vote-only methods.

To fill this gap, we propose a multi-stage framework for trending detection, which achieves systematic optimization from both offline generation and online identification perspectives. Specifically, our framework first exploits selected hot events to generate index queries, establishing a key bridge between static events and dynamic user queries. It then employs a retrieval matching mechanism for real-time online detection of trending queries, where we introduce a cascaded recall and ranking architecture to balance detection efficiency and accuracy. Furthermore, to better adapt to the practical application scenario, our framework adopts a single-recall module as a cold-start strategy to collect online data for fine-tuning the reranker. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our framework significantly outperforms baseline methods in both offline evaluations and online A/B tests, and user satisfaction is relatively improved by 27\\% in terms of positive-negative feedback ratio."}

To address this, we introduce the Influence Score (IS), a novel metric based on Partial Information Decomposition that measures the impact of each retrieved document on the generated response. We validate IS through two experiments. First, a poison attack simulation across three datasets demonstrates that IS correctly identifies the malicious document as the most influential in $86\\%$ of cases. Second, an ablation study shows that a response generated using only the top-ranked documents by IS is consistently judged more similar to the original response than one generated from the remaining documents.

We provide quantitative assessment frameworks, analyze the implications for trust and alignment, and systematically consolidate existing RAG techniques into a unified taxonomy. This document is a practical framework for the deployment of resilient, secure, and domain-adaptable RAG systems, synthesizing insights from academic literature, industry reports, and technical implementation guides. It also functions as a technical reference."}

Current methods partition documents individually, but complex queries need information scattered across multiple sources: the knowledge fragmentation problem. We introduce Cross-Document Topic-Aligned (CDTA) chunking, which reconstructs knowledge at the corpus level. It first identifies topics across documents, maps segments to each topic, and synthesizes them into unified chunks.\n  On HotpotQA multi-hop reasoning, our method reached 0.93 faithfulness versus 0.83 for contextual retrieval and 0.78 for semantic chunking, a 12% improvement over current industry best practice (p < 0.05). On UAE Legal texts, it reached 0.94 faithfulness with 0.93 citation accuracy. At k = 3, it maintains 0.91 faithfulness while semantic methods drop to 0.68, with a single CDTA chunk containing information requiring multiple traditional fragments.\n  Indexing costs are higher, but synthesis produces information-dense chunks that reduce query-time retrieval needs. For high-query-volume applications with distributed knowledge, cross-document synthesis improves measurably over within-document optimization."}

This paper introduces a retrieval-augmented multi-LLM ensemble framework that orchestrates nine state-of-the-art Large Language Models (LLMs) within a structured three-phase pipeline. RAGsemble addresses key limitations of single-model systems by combining the complementary strengths of model families including Gemini (2.0, 2.5, 1.5), OpenAI (GPT-4o, o4-mini), Mistral Large, and Gemma (1B, 4B, 3n-e4b), while grounding outputs in factual data using FAISS-based semantic retrieval. The system architecture consists of three stages: (1) parallel extraction by diverse LLMs, (2) targeted research augmentation leveraging high-performing models, and (3) intelligent synthesis with conflict resolution and confidence-aware scoring. RAG integration provides real-time access to structured part databases, enabling the system to validate, refine, and enrich outputs through similarity-based reference retrieval. Experimental results using real industrial datasets demonstrate significant gains in extraction accuracy, technical completeness, and structured output quality compared to leading single-LLM baselines. Key contributions include a scalable ensemble architecture for industrial domains, seamless RAG integration throughout the pipeline, comprehensive quality assessment mechanisms, and a production-ready solution suitable for deployment in knowledge-intensive manufacturing environments."}

We introduce LiveVectorLake, a dual-tier temporal knowledge base architecture that enables real-time semantic search on current knowledge while maintaining complete version history for compliance, auditability, and point-in-time retrieval. The system introduces three core architectural contributions: (1) Content-addressable chunk-level synchronization using SHA-256 hashing for deterministic change detection without external state tracking; (2) Dual-tier storage separating hot-tier vector indices (Milvus with HNSW) from cold-tier columnar versioning (Delta Lake with Parquet), optimizing query latency and storage cost independently; (3) Temporal query routing enabling point-in-time knowledge retrieval via delta-versioning with ACID consistency across tiers. Evaluation on a 100-document corpus versioned across five time points demonstrates: (i) 10-15% re-processing of content during updates compared to 100% for full re-indexing; (ii) sub-100ms retrieval latency on current knowledge; (iii) sub-2s latency for temporal queries across version history; and (iv) storage cost optimization through hot/cold tier separation (only current chunks in expensive vector indices). The approach enables production RAG deployments requiring simultaneous optimization for query performance, update efficiency, and regulatory compliance.

A natural question is whether standard sparse methods, such as $l_1$ relaxations and greedy pursuits, can reliably recover the optimal coalition structure in this setting. We show that the answer is negative in a PCSG-inspired regime where overlapping coalitions generate highly coherent, near-duplicate columns: the irrepresentable condition fails for the design, and $k$-step Orthogonal Matching Pursuit (OMP) exhibits a nonvanishing probability of irreversible mis-selection. In contrast, we prove that Sparse Bayesian Learning (SBL) with a Gaussian-Gamma hierarchy is support consistent under the same structural assumptions. The concave sparsity penalty induced by SBL suppresses spurious near-duplicates and recovers the true coalition support with probability tending to one. This establishes a rigorous separation between convex, greedy, and Bayesian sparse approaches for PCSG."}

A distinctive feature of these systems is their ability to undergo evolutionary change. Cognitive architectures are now one of the most promising ways to create Artificial General Intelligence systems. One of the main problems of modern cognitive architectures is an excessively schematic approach to modeling the processes of cognitive activity. It does not allow the creation of a universal architecture that would be capable of reproducing higher nervous functions without using a predetermined set of perception patterns. Our paper proposes an evolutionary approach to creating a cognitive architecture. The basis of this approach is the use of a functional core, which consistently generates the intellectual functions of an autonomous agent. We are considering a cognitive architecture that includes components, the interaction of which ensures the evolution of the agent. The discussion of the development of intelligence is carried out using the conceptual apparatus of semiotics. This allows us to consider the task of developing cognitive functions as a problem of establishing a connection between the Merkwelt and the Werkwelt through the creation of the Innenwelt. The problem of early postnatal ontogenesis is investigated on the basis of the theory of constructivism: we discuss the requirements for the functional core and its composition, as well as the mechanism that initiates the process of cognition."}

To address this issue, we conclude the concept of Simulation-Free PSRO and summarize existing methods that instantiate this concept. Additionally, we propose a novel Dynamic Window-based Simulation-Free PSRO, which introduces the concept of a strategy window to replace the original strategy set maintained in PSRO. The number of strategies in the strategy window is limited, thereby simplifying opponent strategy selection and improving the robustness of the best response. Moreover, we use Nash Clustering to select the strategy to be eliminated, ensuring that the number of strategies within the strategy window is effectively limited. Our experiments across various environments demonstrate that the Dynamic Window mechanism significantly reduces exploitability compared to existing methods, while also exhibiting excellent compatibility.

We derive two fundamental failure modes: (1) Entropy Decay, where finite sampling effects cause a monotonic loss of distributional diversity (mode collapse), and (2) Variance Amplification, where the loss of external grounding causes the model's representation of truth to drift as a random walk, bounded only by the support diameter. We show these behaviours are not contingent on architecture but are consequences of distributional learning on finite samples. We further argue that Reinforcement Learning with imperfect verifiers suffers similar semantic collapse. To overcome these limits, we propose a path involving symbolic regression and program synthesis guided by Algorithmic Probability. The Coding Theorem Method (CTM) allows for identifying generative mechanisms rather than mere correlations, escaping the data-processing inequality that binds standard statistical learning. We conclude that while purely distributional learning leads to model collapse, hybrid neurosymbolic approaches offer a coherent framework for sustained self-improvement."}

On the defensive side, agentic capabilities enable continuous monitoring, autonomous incident response, adaptive threat hunting, and fraud detection at scale. Conversely, the same properties amplify adversarial power by accelerating reconnaissance, exploitation, coordination, and social-engineering attacks. These dual-use dynamics expose fundamental gaps in existing governance, assurance, and accountability mechanisms, which were largely designed for non-autonomous and short-lived AI systems. To address these challenges, we survey emerging threat models, security frameworks, and evaluation pipelines tailored to agentic systems, and analyze systemic risks including agent collusion, cascading failures, oversight evasion, and memory poisoning.

This memory pressure limits the maximum batch size and sequence length that can fit on GPUs, and also results in excessive data movements that hinders performance and efficient model scaling. We present MoEBlaze, a memory-efficient MoE training framework that addresses these issues through a co-designed system approach: (i) an end-to-end token dispatch and MoE training method with optimized data structures to eliminate intermediate buffers and activation materializing, and (ii) co-designed kernels with smart activation checkpoint to mitigate memory footprint while simultaneously achieving better performance. We demonstrate that MoEBlaze can achieve over 4x speedups and over 50% memory savings compared to existing MoE frameworks."}

After validating proper isolation of position and content, we apply BFD to state-of-the-art vision models and uncover three phenomena.(i) Attention operates primarily through content. Content-content interactions dominate attention energy, followed by content-position coupling. DINOv2 allocates more energy to content-position than supervised models and distributes computation across a richer mode spectrum. (ii) Attention mechanisms exhibit specialization: heads differentiate into content-content, content-position, and position-position operators, while singular modes within heads show analogous specialization. (iii) DINOv2's superior holistic shape processing emerges from intermediate layers that simultaneously preserve positional structure while contextually enriching semantic content.\n  Overall, BFD exposes how tokens interact through attention and which informational factors - positional or semantic - mediate their communication, yielding practical insights into vision transformer mechanisms."}

To solve this, we propose a Bayesian generative modeling (BGM) approach for arbitrary conditional inference without retraining. BGM learns a generative model of X through an iterative Bayesian updating algorithm where model parameters and latent variables are updated until convergence. Once trained, any conditional distribution can be obtained without retraining. Empirically, BGM achieves superior prediction performance with well calibrated predictive intervals, demonstrating that a single learned model can serve as a universal engine for conditional prediction with uncertainty quantification. We provide theoretical guarantees for the convergence of the stochastic iterative algorithm, statistical consistency and conditional-risk bounds. The proposed BGM framework leverages the power of AI to capture complex relationships among variables while adhering to Bayesian principles, emerging as a promising framework for advancing various applications in modern data science.

We introduce PRISM (Protocol Refinement through Intelligent Simulation Modeling), a framework that automates the design, validation, and execution of experimental protocols on a laboratory platform composed of off-the-shelf robotic instruments. PRISM uses a set of language-model-based agents that work together to generate and refine experimental steps. The process begins with automatically gathering relevant procedures from web-based sources describing experimental workflows. These are converted into structured experimental steps (e.g., liquid handling steps, deck layout and other related operations) through a planning, critique, and validation loop. The finalized steps are translated into the Argonne MADSci protocol format, which provides a unified interface for coordinating multiple robotic instruments (Opentrons OT-2 liquid handler, PF400 arm, Azenta plate sealer and peeler) without requiring human intervention between steps. To evaluate protocol-generation performance, we benchmarked both single reasoning models and multi-agent workflow across constrained and open-ended prompting paradigms. The resulting protocols were validated in a digital-twin environment built in NVIDIA Omniverse to detect physical or sequencing errors before execution. Using Luna qPCR amplification and Cell Painting as case studies, we demonstrate PRISM as a practical end-to-end workflow that bridges language-based protocol generation, simulation-based validation, and automated robotic execution."}

Using Moral Foundations Theory (MFT) as an analytic framework, we study how moral foundations are encoded, organized, and expressed within two instruction-tuned LLMs: Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct and Qwen2.5-7B-Instruct. We employ a multi-level approach combining (i) layer-wise analysis of MFT concept representations and their alignment with human moral perceptions, (ii) pretrained sparse autoencoders (SAEs) over the residual stream to identify sparse features that support moral concepts, and (iii) causal steering interventions using dense MFT vectors and sparse SAE features. We find that both models represent and distinguish moral foundations in a structured, layer-dependent way that aligns with human judgments. At a finer scale, SAE features show clear semantic links to specific foundations, suggesting partially disentangled mechanisms within shared representations. Finally, steering along either dense vectors or sparse features produces predictable shifts in foundation-relevant behavior, demonstrating a causal connection between internal representations and moral outputs. Together, our results provide mechanistic evidence that moral concepts in LLMs are distributed, layered, and partly disentangled, suggesting that pluralistic moral structure can emerge as a latent pattern from the statistical regularities of language alone."}

Our findings reveal that RL alone yields limited improvements when applied to models lacking inherent Korean reasoning capabilities. To address this, we explore several fine-tuning strategies and show that aligning the model's internal reasoning processes with Korean inputs-particularly by tuning Korean-specific neurons in early layers-is key to unlocking RL's effectiveness. We introduce a self-correction code-switching dataset to facilitate this alignment and observe significant performance gains in both mathematical reasoning and self-correction tasks. Ultimately, we conclude that the crucial factor in multilingual reasoning enhancement is not injecting new linguistic knowledge, but effectively eliciting and aligning existing reasoning capabilities. Our study provides a new perspective on how internal translation and neuron-level tuning contribute to multilingual reasoning alignment in LLMs."}

The code could be unstable or erroneous and contain vulnerabilities such as data poisoning, malicious attacks, and hallucinations that could lead to widespread system malfunctions. This prohibits the adoption of LLM generated code in production AI systems where human code reviews and traditional secure testing tools are impractical or untrustworthy. In this paper, we discuss safety and reliability problems with the execution of LLM generated code and propose a Secure Transpiler and Executor of LLM-Generated Program (STELP), capable of executing LLM-generated code in a controlled and safe manner. STELP secures autonomous production AI systems involving code generation, filling the critical void left by the impracticality or limitations of traditional secure testing methodologies and human oversight. This includes applications such as headless code generation-execution and LLMs that produce executable code snippets as an action plan to be executed in real time.

However, when applied to high-dimensional data or data with latent confounders, these methods, often based on off-the-shelf continuous optimization algorithms, struggle with the vast search space, the complexity of the objective function, and the nontrivial nature of graph-theoretical constraints. As a result, there has been a surge of interest in leveraging super-structures to guide the optimization process. Nonetheless, learning an appropriate super-structure at the right level of granularity, and doing so efficiently across various settings, presents significant challenges.\n  In this paper, we propose ALVGL, a novel and general enhancement to the differentiable causal discovery pipeline. ALVGL employs a sparse and low-rank decomposition to learn the precision matrix of the data. We design an ADMM procedure to optimize this decomposition, identifying components in the precision matrix that are most relevant to the underlying causal structure. These components are then combined to construct a super-structure that is provably a superset of the true causal graph. This super-structure is used to initialize a standard differentiable causal discovery method with a more focused search space, thereby improving both optimization efficiency and accuracy.\n  We demonstrate the versatility of ALVGL by instantiating it across a range of structural causal models, including both Gaussian and non-Gaussian settings, with and without unmeasured confounders. Extensive experiments on synthetic and real-world datasets show that ALVGL not only achieves state-of-the-art accuracy but also significantly improves optimization efficiency, making it a reliable and effective solution for differentiable causal discovery."}

The classification branch is enhanced via mask-guided attention, allowing the model to focus on lesion-relevant features while suppressing background artifacts.

Recent advances in Large Language Models (LLMs) offer a promising avenue to automate this complex task, potentially transforming how developers address web performance issues. This study evaluates the effectiveness of nine state-of-the-art LLMs for automated web performance issue resolution. For this purpose, we first extracted the DOM trees of 15 popular webpages (e.g., Facebook), and then we used Lighthouse to retrieve their performance audit reports. Subsequently, we passed the extracted DOM trees and corresponding audits to each model for resolution. Our study considers 7 unique audit categories, revealing that LLMs universally excel at SEO & Accessibility issues. However, their efficacy in performance-critical DOM manipulations is mixed. While high-performing models like GPT-4.1 delivered significant reductions in areas like Initial Load, Interactivity, and Network Optimization (e.g., 46.52% to 48.68% audit incidence reductions), others, such as GPT-4o-mini, notably underperformed, consistently.

Our finding shows: (i) search generally improves answer accuracy on answerable queries but harms abstention on unanswerable ones; (ii) over-searching is more pronounced in complex reasoning models and deep research systems, is exacerbated by noisy retrieval, and compounds across turns in multi-turn conversations; and (iii) the composition of retrieved evidence is crucial, as the presence of negative evidence improves abstention.

Within this realm, Transformers have emerged as the predominant architecture due to their strong ability to capture pairwise dependencies. However, Transformer-based models suffer from quadratic computational complexity and high memory overhead, limiting their scalability and practical deployment in long-term and large-scale MTS modeling. Recently, Mamba has emerged as a promising linear-time alternative with high expressiveness. Nevertheless, directly applying vanilla Mamba to MTS remains suboptimal due to three key limitations: (i) the lack of explicit cross-variate modeling, (ii) difficulty in disentangling the entangled intra-series temporal dynamics and inter-series interactions, and (iii) insufficient modeling of latent time-lag interaction effects. These issues constrain its effectiveness across diverse MTS tasks. To address these challenges, we propose DeMa, a dual-path delay-aware Mamba backbone. DeMa preserves Mamba's linear-complexity advantage while substantially improving its suitability for MTS settings. Specifically, DeMa introduces three key innovations: (i) it decomposes the MTS into intra-series temporal dynamics and inter-series interactions; (ii) it develops a temporal path with a Mamba-SSD module to capture long-range dynamics within each individual series, enabling series-independent, parallel computation; and (iii) it designs a variate path with a Mamba-DALA module that integrates delay-aware linear attention to model cross-variate dependencies. Extensive experiments on five representative tasks, long- and short-term forecasting, data imputation, anomaly detection, and series classification, demonstrate that DeMa achieves state-of-the-art performance while delivering remarkable computational efficiency."}

With the rise of Foundation Models (FMs), particularly Large Language Models (LLMs), there is a new opportunity to generate test oracles that reflect intended behavior. This positions LLMs as enablers of Promptware, where software creation and testing are driven by natural-language prompts.

Given a complex source query $Q_c$ that contains a SQL dialect $d$, we first employ a dialect-aware query reduction technique to derive a simplified query $Q_{s}$ by removing $d$-irrelevant SQL elements from $Q_c$. Subsequently, we utilize LLMs to translate $Q_{s}$ into $Q_{s^{'}}$, and automatically extract the translation rule $r_d$ for dialect $d$ based on the relationship between $Q_{s}$ and $Q_{s^{'}}$. By applying $r_d$ to $Q_c$, we can effectively translate the dialect $d$ within $Q_c$, thereby bypassing the complexity of the source query $Q_c$. We evaluate RISE on two real-world benchmarks, i.e., TPC-DS and SQLProcBench, comparing its performance against both the traditional rule-based tools and the LLM-based approaches with respect to translation accuracy. RISE achieves accuracies of 97.98% on TPC-DS and 100% on SQLProcBench, outperforming the baselines by an average improvement of 24.62% and 238.41%, respectively."}

To address this problem, we propose a context-aware user profiling framework with two trainable components: a query generator that generates optimal queries to retrieve persuasion-relevant records from a user's history, and a profiler that summarizes these records into a profile to effectively inform the persuasiveness prediction model. Our evaluation on the ChangeMyView Reddit dataset shows consistent improvements over existing methods across multiple predictor models, with gains of up to +13.77%p in F1 score. Further analysis shows that effective user profiles are context-dependent and predictor-specific, rather than relying on static attributes or surface-level similarity. Together, these results highlight the importance of task-oriented, context-dependent user profiling for personalized persuasiveness prediction."}

In order to address these issues, we propose Stephanie2, a novel next-generation step-wise decision-making dialogue agent. With active waiting and message-pace adaptation, Stephanie2 explicitly decides at each step whether to send or wait, and models latency as the sum of thinking time and typing time to achieve more natural pacing. We further introduce a time-window-based dual-agent dialogue system to generate pseudo dialogue histories for human and automatic evaluations. Experiments show that Stephanie2 clearly outperforms Stephanie1 on metrics such as naturalness and engagement, and achieves a higher pass rate on human evaluation with the role identification Turing test."}

Determining whether courses at different institutions are equivalent (i.e., articulation) is essential for successful credit transfer, as it minimizes unused credits and increases the likelihood of bachelor's degree completion. However, establishing articulation agreements remains time- and resource-intensive, as all candidate articulations are reviewed manually. Although recent efforts have explored the use of artificial intelligence to support this work, its use in articulation practice remains limited. Given these challenges and the need for scalable support, this study applies artificial intelligence to suggest articulations between institutions in collaboration with the State University of New York system, one of the largest systems of higher education in the US. To develop our methodology, we first surveyed articulation staff and faculty to assess adoption rates of baseline algorithmic recommendations and gather feedback on perceptions and concerns about these recommendations. Building on these insights, we developed a supervised alignment method that addresses superficial matching and institutional biases in catalog descriptions, achieving a 5.5-fold improvement in accuracy over previous methods. Based on articulation predictions of this method and a 61% average surveyed adoption rate among faculty and staff, these findings project a 12-fold increase in valid credit mobility opportunities that would otherwise remain unrealized. This study suggests that stakeholder-informed design of AI in higher education administration can expand student credit mobility and help reshape current institutional decision-making in course articulation."}

To address the challenge, we propose AGDC, a novel unified framework that jointly models discrete and continuous values for variable-length sequences. AGDC employs a hybrid approach that combines categorical prediction for discrete values with diffusion-based modeling for continuous values, incorporating two key technical components: an end-of-sequence (EOS) logit adjustment mechanism that uses an MLP to dynamically adjust EOS token logits based on sequence context, and a length regularization term integrated into the loss function. Additionally, we present ContLayNet, a large-scale benchmark comprising 334K high-precision semiconductor layout samples with specialized evaluation metrics that capture functional correctness where precision errors significantly impact performance. Experiments on semiconductor layouts (ContLayNet), graphic layouts, and SVGs demonstrate AGDC's superior performance in generating high-fidelity hybrid vector representations compared to discretization-based and fixed-schema baselines, achieving scalable high-precision generation across diverse domains."}

In-context learning (ICL) with large language models (LLMs) addresses this problem, but prior work largely focuses on high-resource languages covered during training and text-only settings. This paper investigates whether speech LLMs can learn unseen languages with multimodal ICL (MICL), and how this learning can be used to improve ASR. We conduct experiments with two speech LLMs, Phi-4 and Qwen3-Omni, on three diverse endangered languages. Firstly, we find that MICL is effective for unseen languages, leveraging both speech and text modalities. We further show that cross-lingual transfer learning improves MICL efficiency on target languages without training on them. Moreover, we analyze attention patterns to interpret MICL mechanisms, and we observe layer-dependent preferences between audio and text context, with an overall bias towards text. Finally, we show that prompt-based ASR with speech LLMs performs poorly on unseen languages, motivating a simple ASR system that combines a stronger acoustic model with a speech LLM via MICL-based selection of acoustic hypotheses. Results show that MICL consistently improves ASR performance, and that cross-lingual transfer learning matches or outperforms corpus-trained language models without using target-language data.

Many existing methods extract word embeddings from an LLM, visualise the embedding space via point-plots, and compare the relative positions of certain words.

Here we present a novel tool for analysing and visualising information flow in natural language expressions by applying diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) to word embeddings. We find that DTI reveals how information flows between word embeddings. Tracking information flows within the layers of an LLM allows for comparing different model structures and revealing opportunities for pruning an LLM's under-utilised layers. Furthermore, our model reveals differences in information flows for tasks like pronoun resolution and metaphor detection. Our results show that our model permits novel insights into how LLMs represent actual natural language expressions, extending the comparison of isolated word embeddings and improving the interpretability of NLP models."}

We identify two limitations of this approach: (i) finite SK iterations do not guarantee exact doubly stochasticity, leaving an approximation gap that can accumulate through network depth and undermine stability; (ii) efficient SK implementation requires highly specialized CUDA kernels, raising engineering barriers and reducing portability. Motivated by the Birkhoff--von Neumann theorem, we propose mHC-lite, a simple reparameterization that explicitly constructs doubly stochastic matrices as convex combinations of permutation matrices. This approach guarantees exact doubly stochasticity by construction and can be implemented using only native matrix operations. Extensive experiments demonstrate that mHC-lite matches or exceeds mHC in performance while achieving higher training throughput with a naive implementation and eliminating the residual instabilities observed in both HC and mHC.

In this work, we propose a framework for evaluating how persuasive language generation is affected by recipient gender, sender intent, or output language. We evaluate 13 LLMs and 16 languages using pairwise prompt instructions. We evaluate model responses on 19 categories of persuasive language using an LLM-as-judge setup grounded in social psychology and communication science.

Through a comprehensive grid search of 492 Variational Autoencoder configurations, we show that while skip connections minimize reconstruction error (Mean Absolute Error approximately 0.0012), they induce \"overgeneralization\", allowing the model to reconstruct noise and masking the detection signal.

ADRL achieves robust view completion by propagating feature-level affinity across modalities with neighborhood awareness, and reinforces reconstruction effectiveness by leveraging a stochastic masking strategy. Through disseminating category-level association across label distributions, ADRL refines distribution parameters for capturing interdependent label prototypes. Besides, we formulate a mutual-information-based objective to promote consistency among shared representations and suppress information overlap between view-specific representation and other modalities. Theoretically, we derive the tractable bounds to train the dual-channel network. Moreover, ADRL performs prototype-specific feature selection by enabling independent interactions between label embeddings and view representations, accompanied by the generation of pseudo-labels for each category.

DexterCap uses dense, character-coded marker patches to achieve robust tracking under severe self-occlusion, together with an automated reconstruction pipeline that requires minimal manual effort. With DexterCap, we introduce DexterHand, a dataset of fine-grained hand-object interactions covering diverse manipulation behaviors and objects, from simple primitives to complex articulated objects such as a Rubik's Cube. We release the dataset and code to support future research on dexterous hand-object interaction."}

However, specifying precise goals for these models remains a challenge; text instructions are often too abstract to capture physical nuances, while target images are frequently infeasible to specify for dynamic tasks. To address this, we introduce Goal Force, a novel framework that allows users to define goals via explicit force vectors and intermediate dynamics, mirroring how humans conceptualize physical tasks. We train a video generation model on a curated dataset of synthetic causal primitives-such as elastic collisions and falling dominos-teaching it to propagate forces through time and space. Despite being trained on simple physics data, our model exhibits remarkable zero-shot generalization to complex, real-world scenarios, including tool manipulation and multi-object causal chains. Our results suggest that by grounding video generation in fundamental physical interactions, models can emerge as implicit neural physics simulators, enabling precise, physics-aware planning without reliance on external engines. We release all datasets, code, model weights, and interactive video demos at our project page."}

To enable this task, we adapt MMDialog and ImageChat to create benchmark datasets. We evaluate leading vision-language models (VLMs) against strong textual baselines, highlighting trade-offs in accuracy and efficiency. We present Router-Suggest, a router framework that dynamically selects between textual models and VLMs based on dialog context, along with a lightweight variant for resource-constrained environments. Router-Suggest achieves a 2.3x to 10x speedup over the best-performing VLM.

Our three-stage training strategy first reconstructs the coarse canonical garment via single-layer reconstruction, followed by multi-layer training to jointly recover the inner-layer body and outer-layer garment details. Experiments on two 3D human benchmark datasets (4D-Dress, Thuman2.0) show that our approach achieves better rendering quality and layer decomposition and recomposition than the previous state-of-the-art, enabling realistic virtual try-on under novel viewpoints and poses, and advancing practical creation of high-fidelity 3D human assets for immersive applications.

Global entropy regularization is susceptible to reward hacking, which can induce meaningless verbosity, whereas local token-selective updates struggle with the strong inductive bias of pre-trained models. To address this, we propose Latent Policy Optimization via Iterative Information Bottleneck (IIB-LPO), a novel approach that shifts exploration from statistical perturbation of token distributions to topological branching of reasoning trajectories. IIB-LPO triggers latent branching at high-entropy states to diversify reasoning paths and employs the Information Bottleneck principle both as a trajectory filter and a self-reward mechanism, ensuring concise and informative exploration. Empirical results across four mathematical reasoning benchmarks demonstrate that IIB-LPO achieves state-of-the-art performance, surpassing prior methods by margins of up to 5.3% in accuracy and 7.4% in diversity metrics."}

To address this gap, we propose Neighbor-Consistency Belief (NCB), a structural measure of belief robustness that evaluates response coherence across a conceptual neighborhood. To validate the efficiency of NCB, we introduce a new cognitive stress-testing protocol that probes outputs stability under contextual interference. Experiments across multiple LLMs show that the performance of high-NCB data is relatively more resistant to interference.

However, in real-world deployments, auditing is complicated by the fact that model owners may adaptively update their models in response to changing environments, such as financial markets. These updates can alter the underlying model class while preserving certain properties of interest, raising fundamental questions about what can be reliably audited under such shifts.\n  In this work, we study group fairness auditing under arbitrary updates. We consider general shifts that modify the pre-audit model class while maintaining invariance of the audited property. Our goals are two-fold: (i) to characterize the information complexity of allowable updates, by identifying which strategic changes preserve the property under audit; and (ii) to efficiently estimate auditing properties, such as group fairness, using a minimal number of labeled samples.\n  We propose a generic framework for PAC auditing based on an Empirical Property Optimization (EPO) oracle. For statistical parity, we establish distribution-free auditing bounds characterized by the SP dimension, a novel combinatorial measure that captures the complexity of admissible strategic updates. Finally, we demonstrate that our framework naturally extends to other auditing objectives, including prediction error and robust risk."}

Cedalion is a Python-based open-source framework designed to unify advanced model-based and data-driven analysis of multimodal fNIRS and DOT data within a reproducible, extensible, and community-driven environment. Cedalion integrates forward modelling, photogrammetric optode co-registration, signal processing, GLM Analysis, DOT image reconstruction, and ML-based data-driven methods within a single standardized architecture based on the Python ecosystem. It adheres to SNIRF and BIDS standards, supports cloud-executable Jupyter notebooks, and provides containerized workflows for scalable, fully reproducible analysis pipelines that can be provided alongside original research publications. Cedalion connects established optical-neuroimaging pipelines with ML frameworks such as scikit-learn and PyTorch, enabling seamless multimodal fusion with EEG, MEG, and physiological data. It implements validated algorithms for signal-quality assessment, motion correction, GLM modelling, and DOT reconstruction, complemented by modules for simulation, data augmentation, and multimodal physiology analysis. Automated documentation links each method to its source publication, and continuous-integration testing ensures robustness.

Metrics included Dice similarity coefficient (DSC), intersection over union (IoU), sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy.

Inference-time ensembling provides a practical way to combine these capabilities without retraining. However, existing ensemble approaches suffer from fundamental limitations. Most rely on fixed fusion granularity, which lacks the flexibility required for mid-generation adaptation and fails to adapt to different generation characteristics across tasks. To address these challenges, we propose AdaFuse, an adaptive ensemble decoding framework that dynamically selects semantically appropriate fusion units during generation. Rather than committing to a fixed granularity, AdaFuse adjusts fusion behavior on the fly based on the decoding context, with words serving as basic building blocks for alignment. To be specific, we introduce an uncertainty-based criterion to decide whether to apply ensembling at each decoding step. Under confident decoding states, the model continues generation directly. In less certain states, AdaFuse invokes a diversity-aware scaling strategy to explore alternative candidate continuations and inform ensemble decisions. This design establishes a synergistic interaction between adaptive ensembling and test-time scaling, where ensemble decisions guide targeted exploration, and the resulting diversity in turn strengthens ensemble quality. Experiments on open-domain question answering, arithmetic reasoning, and machine translation demonstrate that AdaFuse consistently outperforms strong ensemble baselines, achieving an average relative improvement of 6.88%.
