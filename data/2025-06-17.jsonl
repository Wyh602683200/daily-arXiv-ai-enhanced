Such conversation is a new capability that\ntraditional `inspective' interpretability methods (opening the black-box) do\nnot use. Having a language model that aims to teach and explain--beyond just\nknowing how to talk--is similar to a teacher whose goal is to teach well,\nunderstanding that their success will be measured by the student's\ncomprehension. While agentic interpretability may trade off completeness for\ninteractivity, making it less suitable for high-stakes safety situations with\npotentially deceptive models, it leverages a cooperative model to discover\npotentially superhuman concepts that can improve humans' mental model of\nmachines. Agentic interpretability introduces challenges, particularly in\nevaluation, due to what we call `human-entangled-in-the-loop' nature (humans\nresponses are integral part of the algorithm), making the design and evaluation\ndifficult. We discuss possible solutions and proxy goals. As LLMs approach\nhuman parity in many tasks, agentic interpretability's promise is to help\nhumans learn the potentially superhuman concepts of the LLMs, rather than see\nus fall increasingly far from understanding them."}

An objective is a measurable function on runs (or infinite\ntrajectories) of the DMDP, and the value for an objective is the maximal\ncumulative reward (or weight) that the controller can guarantee.

Thematic analysis revealed six recurring themes:\nPurposeful Contribution, Adaptive Growth, Positive Relationality, Ethical\nIntegrity, Robust Functionality, and, uniquely for sentient systems,\nSelf-Actualized Autonomy. Study 2 examined how LLMs prioritize these themes\nthrough repeated rankings. Results revealed consistent value structures across\ntrials, with Ethical Integrity and Purposeful Contribution emerging as top\npriorities. Multidimensional scaling and hierarchical clustering analyses\nfurther uncovered two distinct value profiles: human-centric models emphasizing\nethical and relational dimensions, and utility-driven models prioritizing\nperformance and scalability. The PAPERS framework bridges insights from human\nflourishing and human-computer interaction, offering a conceptual foundation\nfor understanding artificial intelligence (AI) well-being in non-sentient and\npotentially sentient systems.

However, this overall trend masks\nsignificant category-specific differences: for certain attack types the\nreasoning models are substantially \\emph{more vulnerable} (e.g., up to 32\npercentage points worse on a tree-of-attacks prompt), while for others they are\nmarkedly \\emph{more robust} (e.g., 29.8 points better on cross-site scripting\ninjection).

Specifically, we prove that any\ntransformer with input length $N$ can be efficiently simulated by only\n$O((N/M)^2)$ transformers with input length $M \\ll N$, and that this cannot be\nimproved in the worst case. However, we then prove that in various natural\nscenarios including average-case inputs, sliding window masking and attention\nsinks, the optimal number $O(N/M)$ of small transformers suffice."}

These\nnetworks are often employed in a frozen state, under the assumption that the\nSSL pre-training has sufficiently equipped them to handle real-world audio.\nHowever, a critical question remains: how well do these models actually perform\nin real-world conditions, where audio is typically polyphonic and complex,\ninvolving multiple overlapping sound sources? Current audio SSL methods are\noften benchmarked on datasets predominantly featuring monophonic audio, such as\nenvironmental sounds, and speech. As a result, the ability of SSL models to\ngeneralize to polyphonic audio, a common characteristic in natural scenarios,\nremains underexplored. This limitation raises concerns about the practical\nrobustness of SSL models in more realistic audio settings. To address this gap,\nwe introduce Self-Supervised Learning from Audio Mixtures (SSLAM), a novel\ndirection in audio SSL research, designed to improve, designed to improve the\nmodel's ability to learn from polyphonic data while maintaining strong\nperformance on monophonic data. We thoroughly evaluate SSLAM on standard audio\nSSL benchmark datasets which are predominantly monophonic and conduct a\ncomprehensive comparative analysis against SOTA methods using a range of\nhigh-quality, publicly available polyphonic datasets. SSLAM not only improves\nmodel performance on polyphonic audio, but also maintains or exceeds\nperformance on standard audio SSL benchmarks.

To this end, we propose the Grouped NonLinear\ntransformation generation method (GroupNL), which generates diversified feature\nmaps by utilizing data-agnostic Nonlinear Transformation Functions (NLFs) to\nimprove the robustness of the CNN model. Specifically, partial convolution\nfilters are designated as seed filters in a convolutional layer, and a small\nset of feature maps, i.e., seed feature maps, are first generated based on\nvanilla convolution operation. Then, we split seed feature maps into several\ngroups, each with a set of different NLFs, to generate corresponding diverse\nfeature maps with in-place nonlinear processing. Moreover, GroupNL effectively\nreduces the parameter transmission between multiple nodes during model training\nby setting the hyperparameters of NLFs to random initialization and not\nupdating them during model training, and reduces the computing resources by\nusing NLFs to generate feature maps instead of most feature maps generated\nbased on sliding windows.

The analysis is structured around four central themes: the\nethical implications of emotional AI, the cultural dynamics of human-machine\ninteraction, the risks and opportunities for vulnerable populations, and the\nemerging regulatory, design, and technical considerations. The authors\nhighlight the potential of affective AI to support mental well-being, enhance\nlearning, and reduce loneliness, as well as the risks of emotional\nmanipulation, over-reliance, misrepresentation, and cultural bias. Key\nchallenges include simulating empathy without genuine understanding, encoding\ndominant sociocultural norms into AI systems, and insufficient safeguards for\nindividuals in sensitive or high-risk contexts. Special attention is given to\nchildren, elderly users, and individuals with mental health challenges, who may\ninteract with AI in emotionally significant ways.

Specifically, we design a variety of\nprompts based on these criteria and elicit responses from large language models\n(LLMs), which we aggregate to make predictions. In addition to demonstrating\nsizable improvements over strong baselines via extensive experiments with\nmultiple LLMs, we provide an in-depth error analysis of the effect of media\npopularity and region on model performance. Further, we conduct an ablation\nstudy to highlight the key components of our dataset that contribute to these\nimprovements.

A formulation for\nactive dendrites using the notational language of conventional machine learning\nis put forward as an alternative to a spiking neuron formulation. Based on this\nformulation, neuromorphic dendrites are developed as basic neural building\nblocks capable of dynamic online clustering. Features and capabilities of\nneuromorphic dendrites are demonstrated via a benchmark drawn from experimental\nneuroscience: spike sorting. Spike sorting takes inputs from electrical probes\nimplanted in neural tissue, detects voltage spikes (action potentials) emitted\nby neurons, and attempts to sort the spikes according to the neuron that\nemitted them. Many spike sorting methods form clusters based on the shapes of\naction potential waveforms, under the assumption that spikes emitted by a given\nneuron have similar shapes and will therefore map to the same cluster. Using a\nstream of synthetic spike shapes, the accuracy of the proposed dendrite is\ncompared with the more compute-intensive, offline k-means clustering approach.\nOverall, the dendrite outperforms k-means and has the advantage of requiring\nonly a single pass through the input stream, learning as it goes.

As a result,\ntemporal redundancy in sequential action generation and spatial redundancy in\nvisual input remain unaddressed. To this end, we propose SP-VLA, a unified\nframework that accelerates VLA models by jointly scheduling models and pruning\ntokens.

To address spatial\nredundancy, we further develop a spatio-semantic dual-aware token pruning\nmethod.

Concretely, we develop\ncontext-oriented singular value decomposition, where we collect covariance\nmatrices of input activations for each linear layer using sampled data from the\ntarget task, and apply SVD to the product of weight matrix and its\ncorresponding covariance matrix. By doing so, the task-specific capability is\ncompacted into the principal components.

However, existing methods\nstruggle with consistently achieving sub-millimeter accuracy, robustness under\nbroad initial pose estimates or need manual key-point annotations. This work\naims to address these challenges by proposing a novel multi-view X-ray/CT\nregistration method for intraoperative bone registration. Methods: The proposed\nregistration method consists of a multi-view, contour-based iterative closest\npoint (ICP) optimization. Unlike previous methods, which attempt to match bone\ncontours across the entire silhouette in both imaging modalities, we focus on\nmatching specific subcategories of contours corresponding to bone\nsubstructures. This leads to reduced ambiguity in the ICP matches, resulting in\na more robust and accurate registration solution. This approach requires only\ntwo X-ray images and operates fully automatically. Additionally, we contribute\na dataset of 5 cadaveric specimens, including real X-ray images, X-ray image\nposes and the corresponding CT scans. Results: The proposed registration method\nis evaluated on real X-ray images using mean reprojection error (mRPD). The\nmethod consistently achieves sub-millimeter accuracy with a mRPD 0.67mm\ncompared to 5.35mm by a commercial solution requiring manual intervention.\nFurthermore, the method offers improved practical applicability, being fully\nautomatic. Conclusion: Our method offers a practical, accurate, and efficient\nsolution for multi-view X-ray/CT registration in orthopedic surgeries, which\ncan be easily combined with tracking systems. By improving registration\naccuracy and minimizing manual intervention, it enhances intraoperative\nnavigation, contributing to more accurate and effective surgical outcomes in\ncomputer-assisted surgery (CAS)."}

It has been argued that this was caused by adding non-useful\nmacros and multiple works have focused on mechanisms to discover effectively\nenvironment-specific useful macros. In this work, we take a slightly different\nperspective. We argue that the difficulty stems from the trade-offs between\nreducing the average number of decisions per episode versus increasing the size\nof the action space. Namely, one typically treats each potential macro-action\nas independent and atomic, hence strictly increasing the search space and\nmaking typical exploration strategies inefficient. To address this problem we\npropose a novel regularization term that exploits the relationship between\nactions and macro-actions to improve the credit assignment mechanism by\nreducing the effective dimension of the action space and, therefore, improving\nexploration. The term relies on a similarity matrix that is meta-learned\njointly with learning the desired policy. We empirically validate our strategy\nlooking at macro-actions in Atari games, and the StreetFighter II environment.\nOur results show significant improvements over the Rainbow-DQN baseline in all\nenvironments.
