Drawing from\ntemporal logic techniques used in hardware verification, this approach monitors\nexecution traces of agent tool calls and state transitions to detect deviations\nfrom expected behavioral patterns. Current error-detection approaches rely\nprimarily on text matching of inputs and outputs, which proves fragile due to\nthe natural language variability inherent in LLM responses. The proposed method\ninstead focuses on the sequence of agent actions -- such as tool invocations\nand inter-agent communications -- allowing verification of system behavior\nindependent of specific textual outputs. The temporal expression language\nprovides assertions that capture correct behavioral patterns across multiple\nexecution scenarios. These assertions serve dual purposes: validating prompt\nengineering and guardrail effectiveness during development, and providing\nregression testing when agents are updated with new LLMs or modified logic. The\napproach is demonstrated using a three-agent system, where agents coordinate to\nsolve multi-step reasoning tasks. When powered by large, capable models, all\ntemporal assertions were satisfied across many test runs. However, when smaller\nmodels were substituted in two of the three agents, executions violated\nbehavioral assertions, primarily due to improper tool sequencing and failed\ncoordination handoffs. The temporal expressions successfully flagged these\nanomalies, demonstrating the method's effectiveness for detecting behavioral\nregressions in production agentic systems. This approach provides a foundation\nfor systematic monitoring of AI agent reliability as these systems become\nincreasingly deployed in critical applications."}

We address this limitation by\nproposing an approach, called \\emph{Locally Adaptive Test-Time Scaling\n(LATTS)}, that allocates variable compute across generation steps.\nSpecifically, at each generation step, LATTS employs a verifier-based\nacceptance criterion to decide whether to resample, backtrack, restart, or stop\nthe generation process.

However, traditional approaches face significant\nchallenges when training Artificial Intelligence (AI) scheduling inferences\noffline, particularly due to the complexities involved in constructing a\ncomprehensive Multi-Schedule Graph (MSG) that accounts for all possible\nscenarios. The process of generating an MSG that captures the vast probability\nspace, especially when considering context events like hardware failures, slack\nvariations, or mode changes, is resource-intensive and often infeasible. To\naddress these challenges, we propose an adaptive online learning unit\nintegrated within the metascheduler to enhance performance in real-time. The\nprimary motivation for developing this unit stems from the limitations of\noffline training, where the MSG created is inherently a subset of the complete\nspace, focusing only on the most probable and critical context events.

This dynamic adaptation allows the\nsystem to handle unexpected events and complex scheduling scenarios more\neffectively. Several RL models were implemented within the online learning\nunit, each designed to address specific challenges in scheduling.

To this end, AOT* atomically maps\nthe generated complete synthesis routes onto AND-OR tree components, with a\nmathematically sound design of reward assignment strategy and retrieval-based\ncontext engineering, thus enabling LLMs to efficiently navigate in the chemical\nspace. Experimental evaluation on multiple synthesis benchmarks demonstrates\nthat AOT* achieves SOTA performance with significantly improved search\nefficiency. AOT* exhibits competitive solve rates using 3-5$\\times$ fewer\niterations than existing LLM-based approaches, with the efficiency advantage\nbecoming more pronounced on complex molecular targets."}

Public sentiment plays a critical role in diplomacy, as a good\nsentiment provides vital support for policy implementation, helps resolve\ninternational issues, and shapes a nation's international image. Traditional\nmethods for gauging public sentiment, such as large-scale surveys or manual\ncontent analysis of media, are typically time-consuming, labor-intensive, and\nlack the capacity for forward-looking analysis. We propose a novel framework\nthat identifies specific modifications for diplomatic event narratives to shift\npublic sentiment from negative to neutral or positive. First, we train a\nlanguage model to predict public reaction towards diplomatic events. To this\nend, we construct a dataset comprising descriptions of diplomatic events and\ntheir associated public discussions. Second, guided by communication theories\nand in collaboration with domain experts, we predetermined several textual\nfeatures for modification, ensuring that any alterations changed the event's\nnarrative framing while preserving its core facts.We develop a counterfactual\ngeneration algorithm that employs a large language model to systematically\nproduce modified versions of an original text. The results show that this\nframework successfully shifted public sentiment to a more favorable state with\na 70\\% success rate. This framework can therefore serve as a practical tool for\ndiplomats, policymakers, and communication specialists, offering data-driven\ninsights on how to frame diplomatic initiatives or report on events to foster a\nmore desirable public sentiment."}

Specifically,\nthe DistilBERT model achieves a near-optimal balance between accuracy and\ncomputational efficiency for textual phishing detection, while Random Forest\nnotably outperforms other classical classifiers in identifying malicious URLs.\nThe modular design allows flexibility for standalone deployment or ensemble\nintegration, facilitating real-world adoption. Collectively, our results\nhighlight the efficacy and practical value of this dual-path approach,\nestablishing a scalable, accurate, and interpretable solution capable of\nenhancing email security against contemporary phishing threats."}

Unfortunately, such surrogate models have been shown to\nfail to generalize to previously unseen patient-treatment combinations.

In this study, we draw inspiration from\nprior work on edge attribution patching (EAP) to investigate the internal\ndifferences of LLMs before and after RL fine-tuning. Our analysis across\nmultiple model families shows two robust effects of online RL post-training:\n(i) an overall increase in activation intensity, indicating that more internal\npathways are engaged and their signals become stronger, and (ii) greater\ndiversity in activation patterns, reflected by higher entropy and less\nconcentrated edge distributions. These changes suggest that RL reshapes\ninformation flow to be both more redundant and more flexible, which may explain\nits advantage in generalization. Notably, models fine-tuned with Direct\nPreference Optimization (DPO) deviate from these trends, exhibiting\nsubstantially weaker or inconsistent internal changes compared to PPO- and\nGRPO-based training. Together, our findings provide a unified view of how RL\nfine-tuning systematically alters the internal circuitry of LLMs and highlight\nthe methodological distinctions between online RL and preference-based\napproaches.

We demonstrate that\nquantization consistently improves calibration for typically underconfident\npre-trained models, while often degrading it for overconfident variants.\nIntriguingly, this degradation in calibration does not preclude gains in other\nreliability metrics; we find that OOD detection can still improve for these\nsame poorly calibrated models. Furthermore, we identify specific\nquantization-aware training (QAT) methods that yield simultaneous gains in\nzero-shot accuracy, calibration, and OOD robustness, challenging the view of a\nstrict efficiency-performance trade-off. These findings offer critical insights\nfor navigating the multi-objective problem of deploying efficient, reliable,\nand robust VLMs by utilizing quantization beyond its conventional role."}

Relative to unclipped GRPO\n(single iteration; no data reuse, ratio always = 1), GR-PSPO achieves similar\nperformance but improves the reasoning leading to clearer and more concise\nresponses which are more logical. Compared to clipped GRPO, GR-PSPO\nsubstantially improves performance both the 0.5B and 1.5B models, with a boost\nof over 20% on GSM8K (39.7% vs. 17.6% for 0.5B, 59.4% vs. 37.8% for 1.5B)."}

We introduce\nDisCoCLIP, a multimodal encoder that combines a frozen CLIP vision transformer\nwith a novel tensor network text encoder that explicitly encodes syntactic\nstructure. Sentences are parsed with a Combinatory Categorial Grammar parser to\nyield distributional word tensors whose contractions mirror the sentence's\ngrammatical derivation. To keep the model efficient, high-order tensors are\nfactorized with tensor decompositions, reducing parameter count from tens of\nmillions to under one million. Trained end-to-end with a self-supervised\ncontrastive loss, DisCoCLIP markedly improves sensitivity to verb semantics and\nword order: it raises CLIP's SVO-Probes verb accuracy from 77.6% to 82.4%,\nboosts ARO attribution and relation scores by over 9% and 4%, and achieves\n93.7% on a newly introduced SVO-Swap benchmark. These results demonstrate that\nembedding explicit linguistic structure via tensor networks yields\ninterpretable, parameter-efficient representations that substantially improve\ncompositional reasoning in vision-language tasks."}

Recent work has shown that, under certain conditions,\nportions of the training set can be reconstructed directly from model\nparameters. Some of these methods exploit implicit bias toward margin\nmaximization, suggesting that properties often regarded as beneficial for\ngeneralization may actually compromise privacy. Yet despite striking empirical\ndemonstrations, the reliability of these attacks remains poorly understood and\nlacks a solid theoretical foundation. In this work, we take a complementary\nperspective: rather than designing stronger attacks, we analyze the inherent\nweaknesses and limitations of existing reconstruction methods and identify\nconditions under which they fail. We rigorously prove that, without\nincorporating prior knowledge about the data, there exist infinitely many\nalternative solutions that may lie arbitrarily far from the true training set,\nrendering reconstruction fundamentally unreliable. Empirically, we further\ndemonstrate that exact duplication of training examples occurs only by chance.\nOur results refine the theoretical understanding of when training set leakage\nis possible and offer new insights into mitigating reconstruction attacks.\nRemarkably, we demonstrate that networks trained more extensively, and\ntherefore satisfying implicit bias conditions more strongly -- are, in fact,\nless susceptible to reconstruction attacks, reconciling privacy with the need\nfor strong generalization in this setting."}

However, RLHF struggles with\ninterpretability and reward hacking because it relies on human judgments that\nusually lack explicit criteria, whereas RLVR is limited in scope by its focus\non correctness-based verifiers. We propose Reinforcement Learning with Binary\nFlexible Feedback (RLBFF), which combines the versatility of human-driven\npreferences with the precision of rule-based verification, enabling reward\nmodels to capture nuanced aspects of response quality beyond mere correctness.\nRLBFF extracts principles that can be answered in a binary fashion (e.g.\naccuracy of information: yes, or code readability: no) from natural language\nfeedback. Such principles can then be used to ground Reward Model training as\nan entailment task (response satisfies or does not satisfy an arbitrary\nprinciple). We show that Reward Models trained in this manner can outperform\nBradley-Terry models when matched for data and achieve top performance on\nRM-Bench (86.2%) and JudgeBench (81.4%, #1 on leaderboard as of September 24,\n2025). Additionally, users can specify principles of interest at inference time\nto customize the focus of our reward models, in contrast to Bradley-Terry\nmodels.
