To quantify\nstructural deviations and semantic discrepancies, we employ several established\nKG metrics, including Instantiated Class Ratio (ICR), Instantiated Property\nRatio (IPR), and Class Instantiation (CI). An automated real-time monitoring\nframework continuously computes deviations between deterministic and\nLLM-generated KGs.

We see an\nopportunity to make such memories more broadly reusable and scalable by moving\nbeyond instance-based memory entries (e.g. exact query/response pairs, or\nsummaries tightly coupled with the original problem context) toward\nconcept-level memory: reusable, modular abstractions distilled from solution\ntraces and stored in natural language. For future queries, relevant concepts\nare selectively retrieved and integrated into the prompt, enabling test-time\ncontinual learning without weight updates. Our design introduces new strategies\nfor abstracting takeaways from rollouts and retrieving entries for new queries,\npromoting reuse and allowing memory to expand with additional experiences. On\nthe challenging ARC-AGI benchmark, our method yields a 7.5% relative gain over\na strong no-memory baseline with performance continuing to scale with inference\ncompute. We find abstract concepts to be the most consistent memory design,\noutscoring the baseline at all tested inference compute scales.

This\npaper introduces a novel multi-modal framework designed to generate\nsemantically rich and structurally aware embeddings of earnings calls, by\nencoding them as hierarchical discourse trees. Each node, comprising either a\nmonologue or a question-answer pair, is enriched with emotional signals derived\nfrom text, audio, and video, as well as structured metadata including coherence\nscores, topic labels, and answer coverage assessments.

We present a cheap, scalable\nmethod for real-time identification of hallucinated tokens in long-form\ngenerations, and scale it effectively to 70B parameter models.

We develop an annotation methodology\nthat leverages web search to annotate model responses with grounded labels\nindicating which tokens correspond to fabricated entities.

Moreover,\nHF-FMs enable the optional usage of device-to-device (D2D) communications,\nenabling horizontal module relaying and localized cooperative training among\nnodes when feasible. Through delving into the architectural design of HF-FMs,\nwe highlight their unique capabilities along with a series of tailored future\nresearch directions.

In this work, we\nreframe the challenge of environment generation as the problem of learning a\ngoal-conditioned, generative world model. We propose a system where a\ngenerative **Attacker** agent learns an implicit world model to synthesize\nincreasingly difficult challenges for a team of cooperative **Defender**\nagents.

This co-evolutionary dynamic creates\na self-scaling curriculum where the world model continuously adapts to\nchallenge the decision-making policy of the agents, providing an effectively\ninfinite stream of novel and relevant training scenarios. We demonstrate that\nthis framework leads to the emergence of complex behaviors, such as the world\nmodel learning to generate flanking and shielding formations, and the defenders\nlearning coordinated focus-fire and spreading tactics.

This paradigm enables models to generate intermediate\nreasoning steps, thereby improving both accuracy and interpretability. However,\ndespite these advancements, a comprehensive understanding of how CoT-based\nreasoning affects the trustworthiness of language models remains\nunderdeveloped. In this paper, we survey recent work on reasoning models and\nCoT techniques, focusing on five core dimensions of trustworthy reasoning:\ntruthfulness, safety, robustness, fairness, and privacy. For each aspect, we\nprovide a clear and structured overview of recent studies in chronological\norder, along with detailed analyses of their methodologies, findings, and\nlimitations. Future research directions are also appended at the end for\nreference and discussion. Overall, while reasoning techniques hold promise for\nenhancing model trustworthiness through hallucination mitigation, harmful\ncontent detection, and robustness improvement, cutting-edge reasoning models\nthemselves often suffer from comparable or even greater vulnerabilities in\nsafety, robustness, and privacy. By synthesizing these insights, we hope this\nwork serves as a valuable and timely resource for the AI safety community to\nstay informed on the latest progress in reasoning trustworthiness.

However,\nreal-world applications involve linguistic variability, requiring models to\nmaintain their effectiveness across diverse rewordings of the same question or\nquery. In this study, we systematically assess the robustness of LLMs to\nparaphrased benchmark questions and investigate whether benchmark-based\nevaluations provide a reliable measure of model capabilities. We systematically\ngenerate various paraphrases of all the questions across six different common\nbenchmarks, and measure the resulting variations in effectiveness of 34\nstate-of-the-art LLMs, of different size and effectiveness. Our findings reveal\nthat while LLM rankings remain relatively stable across paraphrased inputs,\nabsolute effectiveness scores change, and decline significantly. This suggests\nthat LLMs struggle with linguistic variability, raising concerns about their\ngeneralization abilities and evaluation methodologies. Furthermore, the\nobserved performance drop challenges the reliability of benchmark-based\nevaluations, indicating that high benchmark scores may not fully capture a\nmodel's robustness to real-world input variations. We discuss the implications\nof these findings for LLM evaluation methodologies, emphasizing the need for\nrobustness-aware benchmarks that better reflect practical deployment scenarios."}

To address these limitations, we propose a novel\n3D style transfer pipeline that effectively integrates prior knowledge from\npretrained 2D diffusion models. Our pipeline consists of two key stages: First,\nwe leverage diffusion priors to generate stylized renderings of key viewpoints.\nThen, we transfer the stylized key views onto the 3D representation. This\nprocess incorporates two innovative designs. The first is cross-view style\nalignment, which inserts cross-view attention into the last upsampling block of\nthe UNet, allowing feature interactions across multiple key views. This ensures\nthat the diffusion model generates stylized key views that maintain both style\nfidelity and instance-level consistency. The second is instance-level style\ntransfer, which effectively leverages instance-level consistency across\nstylized key views and transfers it onto the 3D representation. This results in\na more structured, visually coherent, and artistically enriched stylization.\nExtensive qualitative and quantitative experiments demonstrate that our 3D\nstyle transfer pipeline significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods\nacross a wide range of scenes, from forward-facing to challenging 360-degree\nenvironments.

We investigate people's preferences for White, Black,\nHispanic, and Asian candidates (represented through names and affinity groups\non quality-controlled resumes) across 1,526 scenarios and measure their\nunconscious associations between race and status using implicit association\ntests (IATs), which predict discriminatory hiring decisions but have not been\ninvestigated in human-AI collaboration.
