Discussions of whether or how to integrate\nlarge language models (LLMs) into everyday life (e.g., acting as proxies for,\nor interacting with, human agents), should be informed by an understanding of\nhow these tools evaluate emotionally loaded stimuli or situations. A model's\nalignment with human behavior in these cases can inform the effectiveness of\nLLMs for certain roles or interactions. To help build this understanding, we\nelicited ratings from multiple popular LLMs for datasets of words and images\nthat were previously rated for their emotional content by humans. We found that\nwhen performing the same rating tasks, GPT-4o responded very similarly to human\nparticipants across modalities, stimuli and most rating scales (r = 0.9 or\nhigher in many cases). However, arousal ratings were less well aligned between\nhuman and LLM raters, while happiness ratings were most highly aligned. Overall\nLLMs aligned better within a five-category (happiness, anger, sadness, fear,\ndisgust) emotion framework than within a two-dimensional (arousal and valence)\norganization. Finally, LLM ratings were substantially more homogenous than\nhuman ratings. Together these results begin to describe how LLM agents\ninterpret emotional stimuli and highlight similarities and differences among\nbiological and artificial intelligence in key behavioral domains."}

Existing HOI generation approaches, such as\ndiffusion-based models, often suffer from artifacts such as implausible\ncontacts, penetrations, and unrealistic whole-body actions, which hinder\nsuccessful execution in physical environments. To address these challenges, we\nintroduce SimGenHOI, a unified framework that combines the strengths of\ngenerative modeling and reinforcement learning to produce controllable and\nphysically plausible HOI. Our HOI generative model, based on Diffusion\nTransformers (DiT), predicts a set of key actions conditioned on text prompts,\nobject geometry, sparse object waypoints, and the initial humanoid pose. These\nkey actions capture essential interaction dynamics and are interpolated into\nsmooth motion trajectories, naturally supporting long-horizon generation. To\nensure physical realism, we design a contact-aware whole-body control policy\ntrained with reinforcement learning, which tracks the generated motions while\ncorrecting artifacts such as penetration and foot sliding. Furthermore, we\nintroduce a mutual fine-tuning strategy, where the generative model and the\ncontrol policy iteratively refine each other, improving both motion realism and\ntracking robustness.

Given the\nsynchronous nature of these jobs, during every iteration there is a\ncomputation-heavy phase, where each GPU works on the local data, and a\ncommunication-heavy phase where all the GPUs synchronize on the data. Because\ncompute-heavy phases require much more power than communication phases, large\npower swings occur. The amplitude of these power swings is ever increasing with\nthe increase in the size of training jobs. An even bigger challenge arises from\nthe frequency spectrum of these power swings which, if harmonized with critical\nfrequencies of utilities, can cause physical damage to the power grid\ninfrastructure.

During the update\nof multiple objects, the learning of small objects' gradients suffers more\nbecause of insufficient gradient updates. Therefore, we propose an inter-class\nrelational loss to efficiently update the gradient of small objects while not\nsacrificing the learning efficiency of other objects based on the simple fact\nthat an object has a spatial relationship to another object (e.g., a car plate\nis attached to a car in a similar position). When the predicted car plate's\nbounding box is not within its car, a loss punishment is added to guide the\nlearning, which is inversely proportional to the overlapped area of the car's\nand predicted car plate's bounding box. By leveraging the spatial relationship\nat the inter-class level, the loss guides small object predictions using larger\nobjects and enhances latent information in deeper feature maps.

This paper addresses this gap by proposing a novel\nconceptual framework (the APCP framework) that charts the transition from AI as\na tool to AI as a collaborative partner. We present a four-level model of\nescalating AI agency within human-AI collaborative learning: (1) the AI as an\nAdaptive Instrument, (2) the AI as a Proactive Assistant, (3) the AI as a\nCo-Learner, and (4) the AI as a Peer Collaborator. Grounded in sociocultural\ntheories of learning and Computer-Supported Collaborative Learning (CSCL), this\nframework provides a structured vocabulary for analysing the shifting roles and\nresponsibilities between human and AI agents. The paper further engages in a\ncritical discussion of the philosophical underpinnings of collaboration,\nexamining whether an AI, lacking genuine consciousness or shared\nintentionality, can be considered a true collaborator. We conclude that while\nAI may not achieve authentic phenomenological partnership, it can be designed\nas a highly effective functional collaborator. This distinction has significant\nimplications for pedagogy, instructional design, and the future research agenda\nfor AI in education, urging a shift in focus towards creating learning\nenvironments that harness the complementary strengths of both human and AI."}

We construct\ntranslated versions of two popular English reasoning datasets, fine-tune Qwen\n2.5 (7B) and Qwen 3 (8B) models, and present a systematic study of long CoT\ngeneration across French, Japanese, Latvian, and Swahili. Our experiments\nreveal three key findings. First, the efficacy of using English as a pivot\nlanguage varies by language: it provides no benefit for French, improves\nperformance when used as the reasoning language for Japanese and Latvian, and\nproves insufficient for Swahili where both task comprehension and reasoning\nremain poor. Second, extensive multilingual pretraining in Qwen 3 narrows but\ndoes not eliminate the cross-lingual performance gap. A lightweight fine-tune\nusing only 1k traces still improves performance by over 30\\% in Swahili. Third,\ndata quality versus scale trade-offs are language dependent: small, carefully\ncurated datasets suffice for English and French, whereas larger but noisier\ncorpora prove more effective for Swahili and Latvian. Together, these results\nclarify when and why long CoTs transfer across languages and provide translated\ndatasets to foster equitable multilingual reasoning research."}

However, the deployment of these models on edge devices remains\nchallenging due to their massive parameter scale and high resource demands.\nWhile post-training quantization (PTQ) has emerged as a widely adopted\ntechnique for compressing AR LLMs, its applicability to dLLMs remains largely\nunexplored. In this work, we present the first systematic study on quantizing\ndiffusion-based language models. We begin by identifying the presence of\nactivation outliers, characterized by abnormally large activation values that\ndominate the dynamic range. These outliers pose a key challenge to low-bit\nquantization, as they make it difficult to preserve precision for the majority\nof values. More importantly, we implement state-of-the-art PTQ methods and\nconduct a comprehensive evaluation across multiple task types and model\nvariants. Our analysis is structured along four key dimensions: bit-width,\nquantization method, task category, and model type. Through this\nmulti-perspective evaluation, we offer practical insights into the quantization\nbehavior of dLLMs under different configurations. We hope our findings provide\na foundation for future research in efficient dLLM deployment. All codes and\nexperimental setups will be released to support the community."}
