Our contributions are fourfold:\n(i) a constraint-based semantics that renders oracle filtering as a\nprogram-logic judgment, (ii) a proof that greedy selection enjoys local\nlikelihood dominance under sound and complete guards (Theorem 2.7), (iii) an\nentropy-style invariant that quantifies factual risk via knowledge-aware safe\nmass, and (iv) a multi-agent operational calculus with verified Lean artefacts\nto certify implementation behaviour.

This paper introduces\nL2M-AID, a novel framework for Autonomous Industrial Defense using\nLLM-empowered, Multi-agent reinforcement learning. L2M-AID orchestrates a team\nof collaborative agents, each driven by a Large Language Model (LLM), to\nachieve adaptive and resilient security. The core innovation lies in the deep\nfusion of two AI paradigms: we leverage an LLM as a semantic bridge to\ntranslate vast, unstructured telemetry into a rich, contextual state\nrepresentation, enabling agents to reason about adversary intent rather than\nmerely matching patterns. This semantically-aware state empowers a Multi-Agent\nReinforcement Learning (MARL) algorithm, MAPPO, to learn complex cooperative\nstrategies. The MARL reward function is uniquely engineered to balance security\nobjectives (threat neutralization) with operational imperatives, explicitly\npenalizing actions that disrupt physical process stability. To validate our\napproach, we conduct extensive experiments on the benchmark SWaT dataset and a\nnovel synthetic dataset generated based on the MITRE ATT&CK for ICS framework.\nResults demonstrate that L2M-AID significantly outperforms traditional IDS,\ndeep learning anomaly detectors, and single-agent RL baselines across key\nmetrics, achieving a 97.2% detection rate while reducing false positives by\nover 80% and improving response times by a factor of four. Crucially, it\ndemonstrates superior performance in maintaining physical process stability,\npresenting a robust new paradigm for securing critical national infrastructure."}

In this work, we propose a hybrid model where we\nactivate reasoning mechanisms in base models at the right time to elicit\nthinking-model-level reasoning chains, implying that thinking models exploit\nalready existing capabilities. To ground our analysis, we introduce an\nunsupervised, bottom-up approach for uncovering human-interpretable reasoning\nbehaviors in thinking models. This approach provides an unbiased method to\ndiscover reasoning behaviors without imposing manual or LLM-derived\nassumptions. Across three base and four thinking models, using GSM8K and\nMATH500, our hybrid model recovers up to 91% of the performance gap to thinking\nmodels without any weight updates while steering only 12% of tokens.\nConcretely, our empirical setup provides a simple, causal way to test the\neffectiveness of existing reasoning mechanisms in base models by invoking them\ndirectly and measuring the resulting task performance.

To this end, we first develop Safe Off-Policy Policy\nGradient (Safe OPG), which is a model-free safe OPL method based on a high\nconfidence off-policy evaluation. In our first experiment, we observe that Safe\nOPG almost always satisfies a safety requirement, even when existing methods\nviolate it greatly. However, the result also reveals that Safe OPG tends to be\ntoo conservative, suggesting a difficult tradeoff between guaranteeing safety\nand exploring novel actions. To overcome this tradeoff, we also propose a novel\nframework called Deployment-Efficient Policy Learning for Safe User\nExploration, which leverages safety margin and gradually relaxes safety\nregularization during multiple (not many) deployments. Our framework thus\nenables exploration of novel actions while guaranteeing safe implementation of\nrecommender systems."}

In this study, we rely solely on a single\nshort-exposure frame, which inherently avoids ghosting and motion blur, making\nit particularly robust in dynamic scenes. To achieve that, we introduce\nUltraLED, a two-stage framework that performs exposure correction via a ratio\nmap to balance dynamic range, followed by a brightness-aware RAW denoiser to\nenhance detail recovery in dark regions. To support this setting, we design a\n9-stop bracketing pipeline to synthesize realistic UHDR images and contribute a\ncorresponding dataset based on diverse scenes, using only the shortest exposure\nas input for reconstruction. Extensive experiments show that UltraLED\nsignificantly outperforms existing single-frame approaches.

We propose DM1 (MeanFlow with Dispersive\nRegularization for One-Step Robotic Manipulation), a novel flow matching\nframework that integrates dispersive regularization into MeanFlow to prevent\ncollapse while maintaining one-step efficiency. DM1 employs multiple dispersive\nregularization variants across different intermediate embedding layers,\nencouraging diverse representations across training batches without introducing\nadditional network modules or specialized training procedures. Experiments on\nRoboMimic benchmarks show that DM1 achieves 20-40 times faster inference (0.07s\nvs. 2-3.5s) and improves success rates by 10-20 percentage points, with the\nLift task reaching 99% success over 85% of the baseline. Real-robot deployment\non a Franka Panda further validates that DM1 transfers effectively from\nsimulation to the physical world. To the best of our knowledge, this is the\nfirst work to leverage representation regularization to enable flow-based\npolicies to achieve strong performance in robotic manipulation, establishing a\nsimple yet powerful approach for efficient and robust manipulation."}

Existing LLM agents suffer from a\ncritical limitation: they are test-time static and cannot learn from\nexperience, lacking the ability to accumulate knowledge and continuously\nimprove on the job. To address this challenge, we propose MUSE, a novel agent\nframework that introduces an experience-driven, self-evolving system centered\naround a hierarchical Memory Module. MUSE organizes diverse levels of\nexperience and leverages them to plan and execute long-horizon tasks across\nmultiple applications. After each sub-task execution, the agent autonomously\nreflects on its trajectory, converting the raw trajectory into structured\nexperience and integrating it back into the Memory Module. This mechanism\nenables the agent to evolve beyond its static pretrained parameters, fostering\ncontinuous learning and self-evolution. We evaluate MUSE on the long-horizon\nproductivity benchmark TAC. It achieves new SOTA performance by a significant\nmargin using only a lightweight Gemini-2.5 Flash model.

Building on this trajectory, we propose an AI-powered bug tracking\nframework that augments existing tools with intelligent, large language model\n(LLM)-driven automation.

In this paper, we present the\nfirst investigation of opponent shaping (OS) with LLM-based agents. Existing OS\nalgorithms cannot be directly applied to LLMs, as they require higher-order\nderivatives, face scalability constraints, or depend on architectural\ncomponents that are absent in transformers.
