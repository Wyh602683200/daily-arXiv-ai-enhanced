Although first-order rules are commonly used in ASPIC+ examples, most\nexisting approaches to reason over rule-based argumentation only support\npropositional rules. To enable reasoning over first-order instances, a\npreliminary grounding step is required. As groundings can lead to an\nexponential increase in the size of the input theories, intelligent procedures\nare needed. However, there is a lack of dedicated solutions for ASPIC+.\nTherefore, we propose an intelligent grounding procedure that keeps the size of\nthe grounding manageable while preserving the correctness of the reasoning\nprocess. To this end, we translate the first-order ASPIC+ instance into a\nDatalog program and query a Datalog engine to obtain ground substitutions to\nperform the grounding of rules and contraries. Additionally, we propose\nsimplifications specific to the ASPIC+ formalism to avoid grounding of rules\nthat have no influence on the reasoning process. Finally, we performed an\nempirical evaluation of a prototypical implementation to show scalability."}

Optimizing\noutcomes for seekers under an individual welfare approach overlooks the\ninherently multi-agent nature of real-world systems, where individuals interact\nand compete for limited resources. To address this, we introduce a novel\nframework for multi-agent algorithmic recourse that accounts for multiple\nrecourse seekers and recourse providers. We model this many-to-many interaction\nas a capacitated weighted bipartite matching problem, where matches are guided\nby both recourse cost and provider capacity.

However, current methods are often computationally\nexpensive and data-intensive, as they require constructing an uncertainty model\nbefore calibration. Moreover, existing approaches typically represent the\nprediction sets with intervals, which limits their ability to capture\ndependencies in multi-dimensional outputs. We address these limitations by\nintroducing zono-conformal prediction, a novel approach inspired by interval\npredictor models and reachset-conformant identification that constructs\nprediction zonotopes with assured coverage. By placing zonotopic uncertainty\nsets directly into the model of the base predictor, zono-conformal predictors\ncan be identified via a single, data-efficient linear program.

Sentiment analysis, in particular, helps firms\nunderstand consumer preferences. While most NLP studies classify sentiment from\nreview text alone, marketing theories, such as prospect theory and\nexpectation--disconfirmation theory, point out that customer evaluations are\nshaped not only by the actual experience but also by additional reference\npoints. This study therefore investigates how the content and format of such\nsupplementary information affect sentiment analysis using LLMs. We compare\nnatural language (NL) and JSON-formatted prompts using a lightweight 3B\nparameter model suitable for practical marketing applications. Experiments on\ntwo Yelp categories (Restaurant and Nightlife) show that the JSON prompt with\nadditional information outperforms all baselines without fine-tuning: Macro-F1\nrises by 1.6% and 4% while RMSE falls by 16% and 9.1%, respectively, making it\ndeployable in resource-constrained edge devices. Furthermore, a follow-up\nanalysis confirms that performance gains stem from genuine contextual reasoning\nrather than label proxying. This work demonstrates that structured prompting\ncan enable smaller models to achieve competitive performance, offering a\npractical alternative to large-scale model deployment."}

Due to the lack of fine-grained\nbehavior-level annotations, detecting specific behavior-level anomalies within\nuser behavior sequences is challenging. Unsupervised methods face high false\npositive rates and miss rates due to the inherent ambiguity between normal and\nanomalous behaviors. In this work, we instead introduce weak labels of behavior\nsequences, which have lower annotation costs, i.e., the training labels\n(anomalous or normal) are at sequence-level instead of behavior-level, to\nenhance the detection capability for behavior-level anomalies by learning\ndiscriminative features. To achieve this, we propose a novel framework called\nRobust Multi-sphere Learning (RMSL). RMSL uses multiple hyper-spheres to\nrepresent the normal patterns of behaviors. Initially, a one-class classifier\nis constructed as a good anomaly-supervision-free starting point. Building on\nthis, using multiple instance learning and adaptive behavior-level\nself-training debiasing based on model prediction confidence, the framework\nfurther refines hyper-spheres and feature representations using weak\nsequence-level labels. This approach enhances the model's ability to\ndistinguish between normal and anomalous behaviors.
