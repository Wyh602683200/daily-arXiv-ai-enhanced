Here, we introduce STELLA, a\nself-evolving AI agent designed to overcome these limitations. STELLA employs a\nmulti-agent architecture that autonomously improves its own capabilities\nthrough two core mechanisms: an evolving Template Library for reasoning\nstrategies and a dynamic Tool Ocean that expands as a Tool Creation Agent\nautomatically discovers and integrates new bioinformatics tools. This allows\nSTELLA to learn from experience. We demonstrate that STELLA achieves\nstate-of-the-art accuracy on a suite of biomedical benchmarks, scoring\napproximately 26\\% on Humanity's Last Exam: Biomedicine, 54\\% on LAB-Bench:\nDBQA, and 63\\% on LAB-Bench: LitQA, outperforming leading models by up to 6\npercentage points. More importantly, we show that its performance\nsystematically improves with experience; for instance, its accuracy on the\nHumanity's Last Exam benchmark almost doubles with increased trials. STELLA\nrepresents a significant advance towards AI Agent systems that can learn and\ngrow, dynamically scaling their expertise to accelerate the pace of biomedical\ndiscovery."}

Judging both the effectiveness and fairness of these\nAI systems, and their human decision making counterpart, is a complex and\nimportant topic studied across both computational and social sciences. Within\nmachine learning, a common way to address bias in downstream classifiers is to\nresample the training data to offset disparities. For example, if hiring rates\nvary by some protected class, then one may equalize the rate within the\ntraining set to alleviate bias in the resulting classifier. While simple and\nseemingly effective, these methods have typically only been evaluated using\ndata obtained through convenience samples, introducing selection bias and label\nbias into metrics. Within the social sciences, psychology, public health, and\nmedicine, audit studies, in which fictitious ``testers'' (e.g., resumes,\nemails, patient actors) are sent to subjects (e.g., job openings, businesses,\ndoctors) in randomized control trials, provide high quality data that support\nrigorous estimates of discrimination. In this paper, we investigate how data\nfrom audit studies can be used to improve our ability to both train and\nevaluate automated hiring algorithms.

Artificial Intelligence (AI) offers a powerful\nsolution for detecting such faults, overcoming many of the limitations\nassociated with traditional fault detection methods. However, the primary\nobstacle to the adoption of AI in this context is the lack of sufficient and\nrepresentative datasets containing faulty image data.\n  This study addresses these challenges by focusing on an interplanetary\nexploration mission scenario. A comprehensive analysis of potential fault cases\nin camera sensors used within the VBN pipeline is presented. The causes and\neffects of these faults are systematically characterized, including their\nimpact on image quality and navigation algorithm performance, as well as\ncommonly employed mitigation strategies. To support this analysis, a simulation\nframework is introduced to recreate faulty conditions in synthetically\ngenerated images, enabling a systematic and controlled reproduction of faulty\ndata. The resulting dataset of fault-injected images provides a valuable tool\nfor training and testing AI-based fault detection algorithms. The final link to\nthe dataset will be added after an embargo period. For peer-reviewers, this\nprivate link is available."}

This turns the associated canonical inclusion resp. projection maps\ninto identity maps and thus avoids costly changes in representation. We present\nthe syntax, semantics, and translation to HOL for the extended language,\nincluding the proofs of soundness and completeness."}

These shortcuts arise from a\nfundamental limitation of discriminative evaluation not shared by evaluations\nof the model's free-form, generative answers. Until recently, there appeared to\nbe no viable, scalable alternative to multiple choice--but, we show that this\nhas changed. We consider generative evaluation via what we call answer\nmatching: Give the candidate model the question without the options, have it\ngenerate a free-form response, then use a modern language model with the\nreference answer to determine if the response matches the reference. To compare\nthe validity of different evaluation strategies, we annotate MMLU-Pro and\nGPQA-Diamond to obtain human grading data, and measure the agreement of each\nevaluation approach. We find answer matching using recent models--even small\nones--achieves near-perfect agreement, in the range of inter-annotator\nagreement. In contrast, both multiple choice evaluation and using\nLLM-as-a-judge without reference answers aligns poorly with human grading.\nImproving evaluations via answer matching is not merely a conceptual concern:\nthe rankings of several models change significantly when evaluating their\nfree-form responses with answer matching. In light of these findings, we\ndiscuss how to move the evaluation ecosystem from multiple choice to answer\nmatching."}

At its core, LiteReality first performs scene\nunderstanding and parses the results into a coherent 3D layout and objects with\nthe help of a structured scene graph. It then reconstructs the scene by\nretrieving the most visually similar 3D artist-crafted models from a curated\nasset database. Next, the Material Painting module enhances realism by\nrecovering high-quality, spatially varying materials. Finally, the\nreconstructed scene is integrated into a simulation engine with basic physical\nproperties to enable interactive behavior. The resulting scenes are compact,\neditable, and fully compatible with standard graphics pipelines, making them\nsuitable for applications in AR/VR, gaming, robotics, and digital twins. In\naddition, LiteReality introduces a training-free object retrieval module that\nachieves state-of-the-art similarity performance on the Scan2CAD benchmark,\nalong with a robust material painting module capable of transferring\nappearances from images of any style to 3D assets -- even under severe\nmisalignment, occlusion, and poor lighting. We demonstrate the effectiveness of\nLiteReality on both real-life scans and public datasets. Project page:\nhttps://litereality.github.io; Video:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ecK9m3LXg2c"}

Following the paradigm introduced by DUSt3R, which unifies\nan image pair densely into a shared coordinate system, subsequent methods\nmaintain an implicit memory to achieve dense 3D reconstruction from more\nimages. However, such implicit memory is limited in capacity and may suffer\nfrom information loss of earlier frames. We propose Point3R, an online\nframework targeting dense streaming 3D reconstruction. To be specific, we\nmaintain an explicit spatial pointer memory directly associated with the 3D\nstructure of the current scene. Each pointer in this memory is assigned a\nspecific 3D position and aggregates scene information nearby in the global\ncoordinate system into a changing spatial feature. Information extracted from\nthe latest frame interacts explicitly with this pointer memory, enabling dense\nintegration of the current observation into the global coordinate system. We\ndesign a 3D hierarchical position embedding to promote this interaction and\ndesign a simple yet effective fusion mechanism to ensure that our pointer\nmemory is uniform and efficient. Our method achieves competitive or\nstate-of-the-art performance on various tasks with low training costs. Code is\navailable at: https://github.com/YkiWu/Point3R."}
