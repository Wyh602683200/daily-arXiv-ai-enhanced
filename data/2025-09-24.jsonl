They can subscribe to commercial LLM services or deploy models on\ntheir own infrastructure. Cloud services from providers such as OpenAI,\nAnthropic, and Google are attractive because they provide easy access to\nstate-of-the-art models and are easy to scale. However, concerns about data\nprivacy, the difficulty of switching service providers, and long-term operating\ncosts have driven interest in local deployment of open-source models. This\npaper presents a cost-benefit analysis framework to help organizations\ndetermine when on-premise LLM deployment becomes economically viable compared\nto commercial subscription services. We consider the hardware requirements,\noperational expenses, and performance benchmarks of the latest open-source\nmodels, including Qwen, Llama, Mistral, and etc. Then we compare the total cost\nof deploying these models locally with the major cloud providers subscription\nfee. Our findings provide an estimated breakeven point based on usage levels\nand performance needs. These results give organizations a practical framework\nfor planning their LLM strategies."}

To this end, we study the performance of GPT-5 on five conjectures\nin combinatorial optimization. For each problem, we provided one or two source\npapers from which the conjecture arose, withheld our own conjecture, and then\nassessed the model's reasoning in detail. On the three easier problems, GPT-5\nproduced nearly correct solutions; for Problem 2 it even derived a different\napproximation guarantee that, upon checking, refuted our conjecture while\nproviding a valid solution. The model failed on Problem 4, which required\ncombining results from two papers. On Problem 5, a harder case without a\nvalidated conjecture, GPT-5 proposed the same algorithm we had in mind but\nfailed in the analysis, suggesting the proof is more challenging than expected.\nAlthough our sample is small, the results point to meaningful progress on\nroutine reasoning, occasional flashes of originality, and clear limitations\nwhen cross-paper synthesis is required. GPT-5 may represent an early step\ntoward frontier models eventually passing the G\\\"odel Test."}

Successive generations, including GPT-o\nseries, DeepSeek-R1, Kimi-K1.5, Grok 4, and GLM-4.5, have relied on large-scale\nRL training to enhance reasoning and coding capabilities. To meet the\ncommunity's growing RL needs, numerous RL frameworks have been proposed. Most\nof these frameworks primarily rely on inference engines for rollout generation\nand training engines for policy updates. However, RL training remains\ncomputationally expensive, with rollout generation accounting for more than 90%\nof total runtime. In addition, its efficiency is often constrained by the\nlong-tail distribution of rollout response lengths, where a few lengthy\nresponses stall entire batches, leaving GPUs idle and underutilized. As model\nand rollout sizes continue to grow, this bottleneck increasingly limits\nscalability. To address this challenge, we propose Active Partial Rollouts in\nReinforcement Learning (APRIL), which mitigates long-tail inefficiency. In the\nrollout phase, APRIL over-provisions rollout requests, terminates once the\ntarget number of responses is reached, and recycles incomplete responses for\ncontinuation in future steps. This strategy ensures that no rollouts are\ndiscarded while substantially reducing GPU idle time. Experiments show that\nAPRIL improves rollout throughput by at most 44% across commonly used RL\nalgorithms (GRPO, DAPO, GSPO), accelerates convergence, and achieves at most 8%\nhigher final accuracy across tasks. Moreover, APRIL is both framework and\nhardware agnostic, already integrated into the slime RL framework, and\ndeployable on NVIDIA and AMD GPUs alike. Taken together, this work unifies\nsystem-level and algorithmic considerations in proposing APRIL, with the aim of\nadvancing RL training efficiency and inspiring further optimizations in RL\nsystems."}

Second, these degraded\nregions can disrupt accurate pixel correspondences, leading to ineffective\nsupervision based on the photometric consistency assumption.

While existing RL strategies such as reinforcement learning from\nhuman feedback (RLHF) and reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards (RLVR)\nrely on human annotation for reward construction, RLPT eliminates this\ndependency by deriving reward signals directly from pre-training data.\nSpecifically, it adopts a next-segment reasoning objective, rewarding the\npolicy for accurately predicting subsequent text segments conditioned on the\npreceding context. This formulation allows RL to be scaled on pre-training\ndata, encouraging the exploration of richer trajectories across broader\ncontexts and thereby fostering more generalizable reasoning skills. Extensive\nexperiments on both general-domain and mathematical reasoning benchmarks across\nmultiple models validate the effectiveness of RLPT. For example, when applied\nto Qwen3-4B-Base, RLPT yields absolute improvements of $3.0$, $5.1$, $8.1$,\n$6.0$, $6.6$, and $5.3$ on MMLU, MMLU-Pro, GPQA-Diamond, KOR-Bench, AIME24, and\nAIME25, respectively. The results further demonstrate favorable scaling\nbehavior, suggesting strong potential for continued gains with more compute. In\naddition, RLPT provides a solid foundation, extending the reasoning boundaries\nof LLMs and enhancing RLVR performance."}

Efficient\ncompression and representation are crucial for analyzing complex motion\ndynamics.

Our approach combines dense\nmotion tokenization with adversarial refinement, which eliminates\nreconstruction artifacts like motion smearing and temporal misalignment\nobserved in non-adversarial baselines. Our experiments on the CMU Panoptic\ndataset provide conclusive evidence of our method's superiority, outperforming\nthe dVAE baseline by 9.31% SSIM and reducing temporal instability by 37.1%.\nFurthermore, our dense tokenization strategy enables a novel analysis of motion\ncomplexity, revealing that 2D motion can be optimally represented with a\ncompact 128-token vocabulary, while 3D motion's complexity demands a much\nlarger 1024-token codebook for faithful reconstruction.

Existing interactive segmentation\nmethods fail to combine high lesion-wise precision with scalability to hundreds\nof lesions. This study proposes a novel interactive segmentation model tailored\nto this challenge.\n  Methods: We introduce MOIS-SAM2, a multi-object interactive segmentation\nmodel that extends the state-of-the-art, transformer-based, promptable Segment\nAnything Model 2 (SAM2) with exemplar-based semantic propagation. MOIS-SAM2 was\ntrained and evaluated on 119 WB-MRI scans from 84 NF1 patients acquired using\nT2-weighted fat-suppressed sequences. The dataset was split at the patient\nlevel into a training set and four test sets (one in-domain and three\nreflecting different domain shift scenarios, e.g., MRI field strength\nvariation, low tumor burden, differences in clinical site and scanner vendor).\n  Results: On the in-domain test set, MOIS-SAM2 achieved a scan-wise DSC of\n0.60 against expert manual annotations, outperforming baseline 3D nnU-Net (DSC:\n0.54) and SAM2 (DSC: 0.35). Performance of the proposed model was maintained\nunder MRI field strength shift (DSC: 0.53) and scanner vendor variation (DSC:\n0.50), and improved in low tumor burden cases (DSC: 0.61).

Yet robot policies often lack\nsufficient exploration capability due to action mode collapse. Existing methods\nthat encourage exploration typically rely on random perturbations, which are\nunsafe and induce unstable, erratic behaviors, thereby limiting their\neffectiveness. We propose Self-Improvement via On-Manifold Exploration (SOE), a\nframework that enhances policy exploration and improvement in robotic\nmanipulation. SOE learns a compact latent representation of task-relevant\nfactors and constrains exploration to the manifold of valid actions, ensuring\nsafety, diversity, and effectiveness. It can be seamlessly integrated with\narbitrary policy models as a plug-in module, augmenting exploration without\ndegrading the base policy performance. Moreover, the structured latent space\nenables human-guided exploration, further improving efficiency and\ncontrollability. Extensive experiments in both simulation and real-world tasks\ndemonstrate that SOE consistently outperforms prior methods, achieving higher\ntask success rates, smoother and safer exploration, and superior sample\nefficiency. These results establish on-manifold exploration as a principled\napproach to sample-efficient policy self-improvement. Project website:\nhttps://ericjin2002.github.io/SOE"}
