However, real-world test data often exhibit domain\nshifts. Test-Time Adaptation (TTA) addresses this challenge by adapting the\nmodel to test data during inference. While most TTA studies assume that the\ntraining and test data share the same class set (closed-set TTA), real-world\nscenarios often involve open-set data (open-set TTA), which can degrade\nclosed-set accuracy. A recent study showed that identifying open-set data\nduring adaptation and maximizing its entropy is an effective solution. However,\nthe previous method relies on the source model for filtering, resulting in\nsuboptimal filtering accuracy on domain-shifted test data. In contrast, we\nfound that the adapting model, which learns domain knowledge from noisy test\nstreams, tends to be unstable and leads to error accumulation when used for\nfiltering. To address this problem, we propose Primary-Auxiliary Filtering\n(PAF), which employs an auxiliary filter to validate data filtered by the\nprimary filter.

In this paper, we\nintroduce a novel hotword customization system that utilizes a hotword\npre-retrieval module (H-PRM) to identify the most relevant hotword candidate by\nmeasuring the acoustic similarity between the hotwords and the speech segment.\nThis plug-and-play solution can be easily integrated into traditional models\nsuch as SeACo-Paraformer, significantly enhancing hotwords post-recall rate\n(PRR). Additionally, we incorporate H-PRM into Audio LLMs through a\nprompt-based approach, enabling seamless customization of hotwords.

However, the extreme data imbalance in these logs, where mundane\nscenarios vastly outnumber rare \"long-tail\" events, leads to brittle and unsafe\npolicies when using standard uniform data sampling. In this work, we address\nthis challenge through a systematic, large-scale comparative study of data\ncuration strategies designed to focus the learning process on information-rich\nsamples. We investigate six distinct criticality weighting schemes which are\ncategorized into three families: heuristic-based, uncertainty-based, and\nbehavior-based. These are evaluated at two temporal scales, the individual\ntimestep and the complete scenario. We train seven goal-conditioned\nConservative Q-Learning (CQL) agents with a state-of-the-art, attention-based\narchitecture and evaluate them in the high-fidelity Waymax simulator. Our\nresults demonstrate that all data curation methods significantly outperform the\nbaseline. Notably, data-driven curation using model uncertainty as a signal\nachieves the most significant safety improvements, reducing the collision rate\nby nearly three-fold (from 16.0% to 5.5%). Furthermore, we identify a clear\ntrade-off where timestep-level weighting excels at reactive safety while\nscenario-level weighting improves long-horizon planning. Our work provides a\ncomprehensive framework for data curation in Offline RL and underscores that\nintelligent, non-uniform sampling is a critical component for building safe and\nreliable autonomous agents."}

In\nparallel, neuro-symbolic AI provides new avenues for designing these agents\nthat are not only adaptive but also scalable across domains. Based on these\nremarks, this paper presents a multi-agent, neuro-symbolic framework designed\nto resolve the aforementioned challenges. The framework assigns distinct\npedagogical roles to specialized agents: an RL-based 'tutor' agent provides\nauthoritative, non-verbal scaffolding, while a proactive, LLM-powered 'peer'\nagent facilitates the social dimensions of learning. While prior work has\nexplored such agents in isolation, our framework's novelty lies in unifying\nthem through a central educational ontology.

First, we propose FairSkillMARL, a framework that defines\nfairness as the dual objective of workload balance and skill-task alignment.\nSecond, we introduce MARLHospital, a customizable healthcare-inspired\nenvironment for modeling team compositions and energy-constrained scheduling\nimpacts on fairness, as no existing simulators are well-suited for this\nproblem. We conducted experiments to compare FairSkillMARL in conjunction with\nfour standard MARL methods, and against two state-of-the-art fairness metrics.\nOur results suggest that fairness based solely on equal workload might lead to\ntask-skill mismatches and highlight the need for more robust metrics that\ncapture skill-task misalignment. Our work provides tools and a foundation for\nstudying fairness in heterogeneous multi-agent systems where aligning effort\nwith expertise is critical."}

As these\nmodels process lossy sRGB inputs and neglect the accessibility of the sensor\nRAW images in many scenarios, e.g., in image and video capturing in edge\ndevices, resulting in sub-optimal performance. RDDM bypasses this limitation by\ndirectly restoring images in the RAW domain, replacing the conventional\ntwo-stage image signal processing (ISP) + IR pipeline. However, a simple\nadaptation of pre-trained diffusion models to the RAW domain confronts the\nout-of-distribution (OOD) issues. To this end, we propose: (1) a RAW-domain VAE\n(RVAE) learning optimal latent representations, (2) a differentiable Post Tone\nProcessing (PTP) module enabling joint RAW and sRGB space optimization. To\ncompensate for the deficiency in the dataset, we develop a scalable degradation\npipeline synthesizing RAW LQ-HQ pairs from existing sRGB datasets for\nlarge-scale training.
