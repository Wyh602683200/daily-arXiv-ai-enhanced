While recent progress has\nfocused on scaling Language and Agent models, the development of sophisticated,\nexplicit World Models remains a key bottleneck, particularly for complex,\nlong-horizon multi-agent tasks. In domains such as robotic soccer, agents\ntrained via standard reinforcement learning in high-fidelity but\nstructurally-flat simulators often fail due to intractable exploration spaces\nand sparse rewards. This position paper argues that the next frontier in\ndeveloping capable agents lies in creating environments that possess an\nexplicit, hierarchical World Model. We contend that this is best achieved\nthrough hierarchical scaffolding, where complex goals are decomposed into\nstructured, manageable subgoals. Drawing evidence from a systematic review of\n2024 research in multi-agent soccer, we identify a clear and decisive trend\ntowards integrating symbolic and hierarchical methods with multi-agent\nreinforcement learning (MARL). These approaches implicitly or explicitly\nconstruct a task-based world model to guide agent learning.

This language-driven world model provides an intrinsic curriculum,\ndense and meaningful learning signals, and a framework for compositional\nlearning, enabling Agent Models to acquire sophisticated, strategic behaviors\nwith far greater sample efficiency.

MLP-SRGAN is trained and validated using high\nresolution (HR) FLAIR MRI from the MSSEG2 challenge dataset. The method was\napplied to three multicentre FLAIR datasets (CAIN, ADNI, CCNA) of images with\nlow spatial resolution in the slice dimension to examine performance on\nheld-out (unseen) clinical data. Upsampled results are compared to several\nstate-of-the-art SR networks. For images with high resolution (HR) ground\ntruths, peak-signal-to-noise-ratio (PSNR) and structural similarity index\n(SSIM) are used to measure upsampling performance. Several new structural,\nno-reference image quality metrics were proposed to quantify sharpness (edge\nstrength), noise (entropy), and blurriness (low frequency information) in the\nabsence of ground truths. Results show MLP-SRGAN results in sharper edges, less\nblurring, preserves more texture and fine-anatomical detail, with fewer\nparameters, faster training/evaluation time, and smaller model size than\nexisting methods.

In this study, we show that,\nwhen an LLM is uncertain, the patterns of disagreement among its multiple\ngenerated responses contain rich clues about the underlying cause of\nuncertainty. To illustrate this point, we collect multiple responses from a\ntarget LLM and employ an auxiliary LLM to analyze their patterns of\ndisagreement.

In this work, we investigate\n\\emph{when} representations for new tasks are formed in language models, and\n\\emph{how} these representations change over the course of context. We focus on\n''transferrable'' task representations -- vector representations that can\nrestore task context in another instance of the model, even without the full\nprompt. We show that these representations evolve in non-monotonic and sporadic\nways, and are distinct from a more inert representation of high-level task\ncategories that persists throughout the context. Specifically, models often\ncondense multiple evidence into these transferrable task representations, which\nalign well with the performance improvement based on more examples in the\ncontext. However, this accrual process exhibits strong locality along the\nsequence dimension, coming online only at certain tokens -- despite task\nidentity being reliably decodable throughout the context. Moreover, these local\nbut transferrable task representations tend to capture minimal ''task scopes'',\nsuch as a semantically-independent subtask, and models rely on more\ntemporally-distributed representations to support longer and composite tasks.\nThis two-fold locality (temporal and semantic) underscores a kind of\njust-in-time computational process underlying language models' ability to adapt\nto new evidence and learn new tasks on the fly."}

Inspired by\nthe significance of the substructure-level contexts in understanding molecule\nstructures, e.g., ring systems, we introduce substructure-level tokenization\nfor text-to-molecule models. Building on our tokenization scheme, we develop an\nimportance-based training strategy that prioritizes key substructures, enabling\nCAMT5 to better capture the molecular semantics. Extensive experiments verify\nthe superiority of CAMT5 in various text-to-molecule generation tasks.\nIntriguingly, we find that CAMT5 outperforms the state-of-the-art methods using\nonly 2% of training tokens. In addition, we propose a simple yet effective\nensemble strategy that aggregates the outputs of text-to-molecule models to\nfurther boost the generation performance.

While absolute positional\nencodings struggle with extrapolation to longer sequences due to fixed\npositional representations, and relative approaches like Alibi exhibit\nperformance degradation on extremely long contexts, the widely-used Rotary\nPositional Encoding (RoPE) introduces oscillatory attention patterns that\nhinder stable long-distance dependency modelling. We address these limitations\nthrough a geometric reformulation of positional encoding. Drawing inspiration\nfrom Lorentz transformations in hyperbolic geometry, we propose Hyperbolic\nRotary Positional Encoding (HoPE), which leverages hyperbolic functions to\nimplement Lorentz rotations on token representations. Theoretical analysis\ndemonstrates that RoPE is a special case of our generalized formulation. HoPE\nfundamentally resolves RoPE's slation issues by enforcing monotonic decay of\nattention weights with increasing token distances. Extensive experimental\nresults, including perplexity evaluations under several extended sequence\nbenchmarks, show that HoPE consistently exceeds existing positional encoding\nmethods. These findings underscore HoPE's enhanced capacity for representing\nand generalizing long-range dependencies. Data and code will be available."}

Our method\nfirst extracts concept-irrelevant representations via a dedicated content\nextractor reinforced by a reversal network, ensuring minimal loss of\ntask-relevant information. A subsequent controllable debiasing module employs\ncontrastive learning to finely adjust the influence of residual conceptual\ncues, enabling the model to either diminish harmful biases or harness\nbeneficial correlations as appropriate for the target task. Evaluated on the\nIMDB and Yelp datasets using three pre-trained architectures, CURE achieves an\nabsolute improvement of +10 points in F1 score on IMDB and +2 points on Yelp,\nwhile introducing minimal computational overhead.

Yet the numerical\nstability of DL models -- particularly during training -- remains\nunderexplored. While inference with DL is relatively stable, training\nintroduces additional variability primarily through iterative stochastic\noptimization. We investigate this training-time variability using FastSurfer, a\nCNN-based whole-brain segmentation pipeline. Controlled perturbations are\nintroduced via floating point perturbations and random seeds. We find that: (i)\nFastSurfer exhibits higher variability compared to that of a traditional\nneuroimaging pipeline, suggesting that DL inherits and is particularly\nsusceptible to sources of instability present in its predecessors; (ii)\nensembles generated with perturbations achieve performance similar to an\nunperturbed baseline; and (iii) variability effectively produces ensembles of\nnumerical model families that can be repurposed for downstream applications. As\na proof of concept, we demonstrate that numerical ensembles can be used as a\ndata augmentation strategy for brain age regression. These findings position\ntraining-time variability not only as a reproducibility concern but also as a\nresource that can be harnessed to improve robustness and enable new\napplications in neuroimaging."}

Building\nlarge models on non-NVIDIA platforms also poses challenges for stable and\nefficient training. To address this, we introduce SpikingBrain, a family of\nbrain-inspired models designed for efficient long-context training and\ninference. SpikingBrain leverages the MetaX GPU cluster and focuses on three\naspects: (1) Model Architecture: linear and hybrid-linear attention\narchitectures with adaptive spiking neurons; (2) Algorithmic Optimizations: an\nefficient, conversion-based training pipeline and a dedicated spike coding\nframework; (3) System Engineering: customized training frameworks, operator\nlibraries, and parallelism strategies tailored to MetaX hardware.\n  Using these techniques, we develop two models: SpikingBrain-7B, a linear LLM,\nand SpikingBrain-76B, a hybrid-linear MoE LLM. These models demonstrate the\nfeasibility of large-scale LLM development on non-NVIDIA platforms.\nSpikingBrain achieves performance comparable to open-source Transformer\nbaselines while using only about 150B tokens for continual pre-training. Our\nmodels significantly improve long-sequence training efficiency and deliver\ninference with (partially) constant memory and event-driven spiking behavior.\nFor example, SpikingBrain-7B attains over 100x speedup in Time to First Token\nfor 4M-token sequences. Training remains stable for weeks on hundreds of MetaX\nC550 GPUs, with the 7B model reaching a Model FLOPs Utilization of 23.4\npercent.

To bridge this gap and better understand\nmodel training at the concept level, we use sparse crosscoders to discover and\nalign features across model checkpoints. Using this approach, we track the\nevolution of linguistic features during pretraining. We train crosscoders\nbetween open-sourced checkpoint triplets with significant performance and\nrepresentation shifts, and introduce a novel metric, Relative Indirect Effects\n(RelIE), to trace training stages at which individual features become causally\nimportant for task performance.
