This \"rule-rigidity\" is a significant barrier to\nbuilding trustworthy autonomous agents. While prior work has shown that\nsupervised fine-tuning (SFT) with human explanations can mitigate this issue,\nSFT is computationally expensive and inaccessible to many practitioners. To\naddress this gap, we introduce the Rule-Intent Distinction (RID) Framework, a\nnovel, low-compute meta-prompting technique designed to elicit human-aligned\nexception handling in LLMs in a zero-shot manner. The RID framework provides\nthe model with a structured cognitive schema for deconstructing tasks,\nclassifying rules, weighing conflicting outcomes, and justifying its final\ndecision. We evaluated the RID framework against baseline and Chain-of-Thought\n(CoT) prompting on a custom benchmark of 20 scenarios requiring nuanced\njudgment across diverse domains. Our human-verified results demonstrate that\nthe RID framework significantly improves performance, achieving a 95% Human\nAlignment Score (HAS), compared to 80% for the baseline and 75% for CoT.\nFurthermore, it consistently produces higher-quality, intent-driven reasoning.\nThis work presents a practical, accessible, and effective method for steering\nLLMs from literal instruction-following to liberal, goal-oriented reasoning,\npaving the way for more reliable and pragmatic AI agents."}

An alternative is to perform RL from human feedback, which involves\nlearning a reward function from scratch by collecting human preferences over\npairs of trajectories. However, building such datasets is costly. To address\nthe limitations of both approaches, we propose Preference-Based Reward Repair\n(PBRR): an automated iterative framework that repairs a human-specified proxy\nreward function by learning an additive, transition-dependent correction term\nfrom preferences. A manually specified reward function can yield policies that\nare highly suboptimal under the ground-truth objective, yet corrections on only\na few transitions may suffice to recover optimal performance.

Tools assessing attitudes toward artificial\nintelligence (AI) can provide a base for measuring attitudes specific to LLMs.\nThe 5-item Attitudes Toward Artificial Intelligence (ATAI) scale, which\nmeasures two dimensions, the AI Fear and the AI Acceptance, has been recently\nadopted and adapted to develop new instruments in English using a sample from\nthe UK: the Attitudes Toward General LLMs (AT-GLLM) and Attitudes Toward\nPrimary LLM (AT-PLLM) scales. In this paper, we translate the two scales,\nAT-GLLM and AT-PLLM, and validate them using a sample of 249 Arabic-speaking\nadults. The results show that the scale, translated into Arabic, is a reliable\nand valid tool that can be used for the Arab population and language.\nPsychometric analyses confirmed a two-factor structure, strong measurement\ninvariance across genders, and good internal reliability. The scales also\ndemonstrated strong convergent and discriminant validity. Our scales will\nsupport research in a non-Western context, a much-needed effort to help draw a\nglobal picture of LLM perceptions, and will also facilitate localized research\nand policy-making in the Arab region."}

Product Quantization is employed to discretize\nthe continuous reaction vectors into structured, compositional sub-words.\nSubsequently, a multi-task Transformer model, termed PQ-BERT, is pre-trained to\nlearn the deep contextual grammar of these behavioral codes.

The attack operates solely on weight\ndifferentials without access to raw speech from target speakers. We demonstrate\nattack feasibility on sensitive demographic and clinical attributes: gender,\nage, accent, emotion, and dysarthria. Our findings indicate that attributes\nthat are underrepresented or absent in the pre-training data are more\nvulnerable to such inference attacks. In particular, information about accents\ncan be reliably inferred from all models. Our findings expose previously\nundocumented vulnerabilities in federated ASR models and offer insights towards\nimproved security."}

The HSG concretizes these ideas through categorical\nconstruction, defined by three orthogonal axes: the state-depth axis, the\nmapping-hierarchy axis, and the temporal axis incorporating the principle of\n'no future reference.' Through these, the identity of 'definition = state' is\nformally established as a categorical property.

To address this, we propose to leverage derendering\n-- the process of reverse-engineering visuals into executable code -- as a new\nmodality for verifiable visual reasoning. Specifically, we propose RECODE, an\nagentic framework that first generates multiple candidate programs to reproduce\nthe input image. It then uses a critic to select the most faithful\nreconstruction and iteratively refines the code. This process not only\ntransforms an ambiguous perceptual task into a verifiable, symbolic problem,\nbut also enables precise calculations and logical inferences later on. On\nvarious visual reasoning benchmarks such as CharXiv, ChartQA, and Geometry3K,\nRECODE significantly outperforms methods that do not leverage code or only use\ncode for drawing auxiliary lines or cropping. Our work demonstrates that\ngrounding visual perception in executable code provides a new path toward more\naccurate and verifiable multimodal reasoning."}

Its core idea is spatially guided\nvision-language-action training, where spatial grounding serves as the critical\nlink between instructions and robot actions. InternVLA-M1 employs a two-stage\npipeline: (i) spatial grounding pre-training on over 2.3M spatial reasoning\ndata to determine ``where to act'' by aligning instructions with visual,\nembodiment-agnostic positions, and (ii) spatially guided action post-training\nto decide ``how to act'' by generating embodiment-aware actions through\nplug-and-play spatial prompting. This spatially guided training recipe yields\nconsistent gains: InternVLA-M1 outperforms its variant without spatial guidance\nby +14.6% on SimplerEnv Google Robot, +17% on WidowX, and +4.3% on LIBERO\nFranka, while demonstrating stronger spatial reasoning capability in box,\npoint, and trace prediction. To further scale instruction following, we built a\nsimulation engine to collect 244K generalizable pick-and-place episodes,\nenabling a 6.2% average improvement across 200 tasks and 3K+ objects. In\nreal-world clustered pick-and-place, InternVLA-M1 improved by 7.3%, and with\nsynthetic co-training, achieved +20.6% on unseen objects and novel\nconfigurations. Moreover, in long-horizon reasoning-intensive scenarios, it\nsurpassed existing works by over 10%. These results highlight spatially guided\ntraining as a unifying principle for scalable and resilient generalist robots.\nCode and models are available at\nhttps://github.com/InternRobotics/InternVLA-M1."}

Despite rapidly rising compute budgets,\nthere is no principled understanding of how to evaluate algorithmic\nimprovements for scaling RL compute. We present the first large-scale\nsystematic study, amounting to more than 400,000 GPU-hours, that defines a\nprincipled framework for analyzing and predicting RL scaling in LLMs. We fit\nsigmoidal compute-performance curves for RL training and ablate a wide range of\ncommon design choices to analyze their effects on asymptotic performance and\ncompute efficiency. We observe: (1) Not all recipes yield similar asymptotic\nperformance, (2) Details such as loss aggregation, normalization, curriculum,\nand off-policy algorithm primarily modulate compute efficiency without\nmaterially shifting the asymptote, and (3) Stable, scalable recipes follow\npredictable scaling trajectories, enabling extrapolation from smaller-scale\nruns. Combining these insights, we propose a best-practice recipe, ScaleRL, and\ndemonstrate its effectiveness by successfully scaling and predicting validation\nperformance on a single RL run scaled up to 100,000 GPU-hours.

In order to improve the\nrobustness/defense of RL systems against adversaries, studying various\nadversarial attacks on RL systems is very important. Most previous work\nconsidered deterministic adversarial attack strategies in MDP, which the\nrecipient (victim) agent can defeat by reversing the deterministic attacks. In\nthis paper, we propose a provably ``invincible'' or ``uncounterable'' type of\nadversarial attack on RL. The attackers apply a rate-distortion\ninformation-theoretic approach to randomly change agents' observations of the\ntransition kernel (or other properties) so that the agent gains zero or very\nlimited information about the ground-truth kernel (or other properties) during\nthe training. We derive an information-theoretic lower bound on the recipient\nagent's reward regret and show the impact of rate-distortion attacks on\nstate-of-the-art model-based and model-free algorithms. We also extend this\nnotion of an information-theoretic approach to other types of adversarial\nattack, such as state observation attacks."}

Addressing these challenges, our work makes three primary\ncontributions. First, we introduce Honey-Data-15M, a new SFT dataset comprising\napproximately 15 million QA pairs, processed through multiple cleaning\ntechniques and enhanced with a novel dual-level (short and long) CoT enrichment\nstrategy. Second, we introduce HoneyPipe, the data curation pipeline, and its\nunderlying framework DataStudio, providing the community with a transparent and\nadaptable methodology for data curation that moves beyond static dataset\nreleases. Finally, to validate our dataset and pipeline, we train Bee-8B, an 8B\nmodel on Honey-Data-15M. Experiments show that Bee-8B establishes a new\nstate-of-the-art (SOTA) for fully open MLLMs, achieving performance that is\ncompetitive with, and in some cases surpasses, recent semi-open models such as\nInternVL3.5-8B.
