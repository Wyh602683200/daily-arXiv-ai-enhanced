These agents\nself-organize into evolving networks, continually producing and peer-reviewing\nfindings under shared standards of evaluation. Experiments show that such\nsocial dynamics enable the accumulation of expert-rated results along the\ndiversity-quality-novelty frontier, including rediscoveries of established\nbiomarkers, extensions of known pathways, and proposals of new therapeutic\ntargets.

Then, the LLM invoked to\ngenerate a semantically equivalent fix for this isolated segment. This combined\narchitecture successfully resolves complex repair cases intractable for\nrule-based repair while avoiding the semantic errors of LLM-only approaches.\nOur work provides a validated methodology for solving such problems in\nautomated repair, improving the repair rate by 15.4%p over the\nstate-of-the-art.

Although Large Language Models (LLMs) have recently demonstrated\nsignificant advancements across various domains including translation and\nsummarization, human consciousness is not something to imitate with current\nupfront technology owing to so-called hallucination. This study, therefore,\nproposes a novel approach to address these challenges by integrating\npsychoanalysis and the Myers-Briggs Type Indicator (MBTI) into constructing\nconsciousness and personality modules. We developed three artificial\nconsciousnesses (self-awareness, unconsciousness, and preconsciousness) based\non the principles of psychoanalysis. Additionally, we designed 16 characters\nwith different personalities representing the sixteen MBTI types, with several\nattributes such as needs, status, and memories. To determine if our model's\nartificial consciousness exhibits human-like cognition, we created ten distinct\nsituations considering seven attributes such as emotional understanding and\nlogical thinking. The decision-making process of artificial consciousness and\nthe final action were evaluated in three ways: survey evaluation, three-tier\nclassification via ChatGPT, and qualitative review. Both quantitative and\nqualitative analyses indicated a high likelihood of well-simulated\nconsciousness, although the difference in response between different characters\nand consciousnesses was not very significant.

In this paper, we\nintroduce Energy-Driven Steering (EDS), a novel, fine-tuning free framework\ndesigned to resolve this challenge through dynamic, inference-time\nintervention. We trained a lightweight, external Energy-Based Model (EBM) to\nassign high energy to undesirable (false refusal or jailbreak) states and low\nenergy to desirable (helpful response or safe reject) ones.

To address these issues, we propose Intelligent\nGeneral-sum Constrained Adversarial Reinforcement Learning (IGCARL), a novel\nrobust autonomous driving approach that consists of a strategic targeted\nadversary and a robust driving agent.

We then leverage this model to assess whether new\ndata resembles previously seen failures and steer the generation away from\nthem. We show that BaNEL can improve model performance without observing a\nsingle successful sample on several sparse-reward tasks, outperforming existing\nnovelty-bonus approaches by up to several orders of magnitude in success rate,\nwhile using fewer reward evaluations."}

In this work, we\nintroduce Prompting Test-Time Scaling (P-TTS), a simple yet effective\ninference-time data augmentation strategy for enhancing LLM reasoning through\nfinetuning. Rather than collecting thousands or even millions of examples,\nP-TTS leverages a small pool of only 90 manually selected reasoning instances\nand systematically varies exemplar augmentation through principled instruction\nprompting intensities at test time to synthesize diverse reasoning trajectory\ncontexts. Then we finetune the various sizes of Qwen-2.5 models on P-TTS data.\nAcross a suite of mathematical reasoning AIME2024 & 25, MATH500, and\nGPQA-Diamond, our P-TTS-7B and 32B models outperform the prior competitive\nbaselines like S1 and S1.1 (1K-shot), achieving absolute accuracy gains of\n+26.66% and +30.00% on AIME'24 (7B), and +13.34% and +6.67% on AIME'25 (7B);\nP-TTS-32B yields gains of +23.33% and +16.63% on AIME'24, and +26.63% and\n+3.33% on AIME'25 (vs. S1 and S1.1, respectively), with comparable or better\nperformance on MATH500 and GPQA-Diamond. We further show that P-TTS enhances\nzero-shot generalization accuracy on out-of-domain reasoning benchmarks of\nGaokao, Kaoyan, OlympiadBench, AMC23, GradeSchoolMath, and Minerva. Our\nanalysis suggests that test-time scaling effectively explores the latent space\nof reasoning patterns, amplifying LLM problem-solving with minimal annotation\noverhead, and further unlocking the reasoning potential and capabilities of\nLLMs. Prompting Test-Time Scaling offers a practical, low-cost way to elicit\nLLM reasoning in resource-constrained or rapidly evolving domains."}

Processing entire videos\nwith full attention leads to quadratic computational costs and poor performance\non long videos. Meanwhile, simple sliding window methods are also flawed, as\nthey either break coherence or suffer from high latency due to redundant\nrecomputation. In this paper, we introduce StreamingVLM, a model designed for\nreal-time, stable understanding of infinite visual input. Our approach is a\nunified framework that aligns training with streaming inference. During\ninference, we maintain a compact KV cache by reusing states of attention sinks,\na short window of recent vision tokens, and a long window of recent text\ntokens. This streaming ability is instilled via a simple supervised fine-tuning\n(SFT) strategy that applies full attention on short, overlapped video chunks,\nwhich effectively mimics the inference-time attention pattern without training\non prohibitively long contexts. For evaluation, we build Inf-Streams-Eval, a\nnew benchmark with videos averaging over two hours that requires dense,\nper-second alignment between frames and text. On Inf-Streams-Eval, StreamingVLM\nachieves a 66.18% win rate against GPT-4O mini and maintains stable, real-time\nperformance at up to 8 FPS on a single NVIDIA H100. Notably, our SFT strategy\nalso enhances general VQA abilities without any VQA-specific fine-tuning,\nimproving performance on LongVideoBench by +4.30 and OVOBench Realtime by\n+5.96.
