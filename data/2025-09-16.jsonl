Similar constraints apply in\nsynthetic biology and bioengineering, where the locus of control is often\ngenomic rather than environmental perturbation.\n  A key open question is whether artificial or biological collectives can be\nguided by free-form natural language alone, without task-specific tuning or\ncarefully designed evaluation metrics. We provide one possible answer here by\nshowing, for the first time, that simple agents' collective behavior can be\nguided by free-form language prompts: one AI model transforms an imperative\nprompt into an intervention that is applied to simulated cells; a second AI\nmodel scores how well the prompt describes the resulting cellular dynamics; and\nthe former AI model is evolved to improve the scores generated by the latter.\n  Unlike previous work, our method does not require engineered fitness\nfunctions or domain-specific prompt design.

This limitation leads to reduced\ninterpretability and insufficient instructional support from the ITS. To\naddress this challenge, we propose AlignKT, which employs a frontend-to-backend\narchitecture to explicitly model a stable knowledge state. In this approach,\nthe preliminary knowledge state is aligned with an additional criterion.\nSpecifically, we define an ideal knowledge state based on pedagogical theories\nas the alignment criterion, providing a foundation for interpretability. We\nutilize five encoders to implement this set-up, and incorporate a contrastive\nlearning module to enhance the robustness of the alignment process.

EgoMem operates with three asynchronous processes: (i) a retrieval\nprocess that dynamically identifies user via face and voice, and gathers\nrelevant context from a long-term memory; (ii) an omnimodal dialog process that\ngenerates personalized audio responses based on the retrieved context; and\n(iii) a memory management process that automatically detects dialog boundaries\nfrom omnimodal streams, and extracts necessary information to update the\nlong-term memory. Unlike existing memory agents for LLMs, EgoMem relies\nentirely on raw audiovisual streams, making it especially suitable for\nlifelong, real-time, and embodied scenarios. Experimental results demonstrate\nthat EgoMem's retrieval and memory management modules achieve over 95% accuracy\non the test set.

BuildingGym integrates\nEnergyPlus as its core simulator, making it suitable for both system-level and\nroom-level control. Additionally, BuildingGym is able to accept external\nsignals as control inputs instead of taking the building as a stand-alone\nentity. This feature makes BuildingGym applicable for more flexible\nenvironments, e.g. smart grid and EVs community. The tool provides several\nbuilt-in RL algorithms for control strategy training, simplifying the process\nfor building managers to obtain optimal control strategies. Users can achieve\nthis by following a few straightforward steps to configure BuildingGym for\noptimization control for common problems in the building energy management\nfield. Moreover, AI specialists can easily implement and test state-of-the-art\ncontrol algorithms within the platform. BuildingGym bridges the gap between\nbuilding managers and AI specialists by allowing for the easy configuration and\nreplacement of RL algorithms, simulators, and control environments or problems.\nWith BuildingGym, we efficiently set up training tasks for cooling load\nmanagement, targeting both constant and dynamic cooling load management.

A key difficulty in cross-language translation is that one has to\nre-express the intended behavior of the source program into idiomatic\nconstructs of a different target language. This task needs abstracting away\nfrom the source language-specific details, while keeping the overall\nfunctionality the same. In this work, we propose a novel and systematic\napproach for making such translation amenable to automation based on a\nframework we call program skeletons. A program skeleton retains the high-level\nstructure of the source program by abstracting away and effectively summarizing\nlower-level concrete code fragments, which can be mechanically translated to\nthe target programming language. A skeleton, by design, permits many different\nways of filling in the concrete implementation for fragments, which can work in\nconjunction with existing data-driven code synthesizers. Most importantly,\nskeletons can conceptually enable sound decomposition, i.e., if each individual\nfragment is correctly translated, taken together with the mechanically\ntranslated skeleton, the final translated program is deemed to be correct as a\nwhole. We present a prototype system called Skel embodying the idea of\nskeleton-based translation from Python to JavaScript. Our results show\npromising scalability compared to prior works.

We\npropose DSRAG (Domain-Specific RAG), a multimodal knowledge graph-driven\nretrieval-augmented generation framework designed for domain-specific\napplications. Our approach leverages domain-specific documents as the primary\nknowledge source, integrating heterogeneous information such as text, images,\nand tables to construct a multimodal knowledge graph covering both conceptual\nand instance layers. Building on this foundation, we introduce semantic pruning\nand structured subgraph retrieval mechanisms, combining knowledge graph context\nand vector retrieval results to guide the language model towards producing more\nreliable responses. Evaluations using the Langfuse multidimensional scoring\nmechanism show that our method excels in domain-specific question answering,\nvalidating the efficacy of integrating multimodal knowledge graphs with\nretrieval-augmented generation."}

However, these two stages are optimized for\ndifferent objectives: semantic reconstruction during tokenizer pretraining\nversus user interaction modeling during recommender training. This objective\nmisalignment leads to two key limitations: (i) suboptimal static tokenization,\nwhere fixed token assignments fail to reflect diverse usage contexts; and (ii)\ndiscarded pretrained semantics, where pretrained knowledge - typically from\nlanguage model embeddings - is overwritten during recommender training on user\ninteractions. To address these limitations, we propose to learn DEcomposed\nCOntextual Token Representations (DECOR), a unified framework that preserves\npretrained semantics while enhancing the adaptability of token embeddings.\nDECOR introduces contextualized token composition to refine token embeddings\nbased on user interaction context, and decomposed embedding fusion that\nintegrates pretrained codebook embeddings with newly learned collaborative\nembeddings.

To address these challenges, we apply Latent Replay, a\nneuroscience-inspired approach, to diffusion models. Traditional replay methods\nmitigate forgetting by storing and revisiting past examples, typically\nrequiring large collections of images. Latent Replay instead retains only\ncompact, high-level feature representations extracted from the model's internal\narchitecture.

Thus, we establish that robustness has a precise limit: For\nbinary outputs no scheme can survive if more than half of the encoded bits are\nmodified, and for an alphabet of size q the corresponding threshold is\n$(1-1/q)$ of the symbols.\n  Complementing this impossibility, we give explicit constructions that meet\nthe bound up to a constant slack.

Using\nthe BraTS 2020 dataset of multi-modal brain MRIs, we evaluated a\ngeneral-purpose vision-language LLM (LLaMA 3.2 Instruct) both before and after\nfine-tuning, and benchmarked its performance against custom 3D CNNs. For glioma\nclassification (Low-Grade vs. High-Grade), the CNN achieved 80% accuracy and\nbalanced precision and recall. The general LLM reached 76% accuracy but\nsuffered from a specificity of only 18%, often misclassifying Low-Grade tumors.\nFine-tuning improved specificity to 55%, but overall performance declined\n(e.g., accuracy dropped to 72%). For segmentation, three methods - center\npoint, bounding box, and polygon extraction, were implemented. CNNs accurately\nlocalized gliomas, though small tumors were sometimes missed. In contrast, LLMs\nconsistently clustered predictions near the image center, with no distinction\nof glioma size, location, or placement. Fine-tuning improved output formatting\nbut failed to meaningfully enhance spatial accuracy. The bounding polygon\nmethod yielded random, unstructured outputs. Overall, CNNs outperformed LLMs in\nboth tasks. LLMs showed limited spatial understanding and minimal improvement\nfrom fine-tuning, indicating that, in their current form, they are not\nwell-suited for image-based tasks. More rigorous fine-tuning or alternative\ntraining strategies may be needed for LLMs to achieve better performance,\nrobustness, and utility in the medical space."}

Although this scheme is simple to implement, it\ntends to overly focus on local information, potentially leading to the neglect\nor omission of crucial global information. To mitigate this issue, we propose\nJudge Q, a novel training method which incorporates a soft token list. This\nmethod only tunes the model's embedding layer at a low training cost.

In contrast, AI humor\ndemonstrated increasing processing efficiency and emotional reward, with a\ndecreasing N400 and an increasing LPP.

Its applicability is\nvalidated through two case studies on AI fairness and AI incident reporting.\n  Findings: The case studies demonstrate the framework's ability to identify\ngaps in legal mandates, standardization, and implementation. It adapts to both\nglobal and region-specific AI governance needs, mapping regulatory mandates\nwith practical applications to improve compliance and risk management.\n  Practical Implications - By offering a clear and actionable roadmap, this\nwork contributes to global AI governance by equipping policymakers, regulators,\nand industry stakeholders with a model to enhance compliance and risk\nmanagement.\n  Social Implications: The framework supports the development of policies that\nbuild public trust and promote the ethical use of AI for the benefit of\nsociety.\n  Originality/Value: This study proposes a five-layer AI governance framework\nthat bridges high-level regulatory mandates and implementation guidelines.\nValidated through case studies on AI fairness and incident reporting, it\nidentifies gaps such as missing standardized assessment procedures and\nreporting mechanisms, providing a structured foundation for targeted governance\nmeasures."}

A key reason for\nthis fragility is their reliance on local texture cues rather than global\nobject shapes -- a stark contrast to human perception. To address this, we\npropose two complementary regularization strategies designed to encourage\nshape-biased representations and enhance robustness. The first introduces an\nauxiliary loss that enforces feature consistency between original and\nlow-frequency filtered inputs, discouraging dependence on high-frequency\ntextures. The second incorporates supervised contrastive learning to structure\nthe feature space around class-consistent, shape-relevant representations.\nEvaluated on the CIFAR-10-C benchmark, both methods improve corruption\nrobustness without degrading clean accuracy.

Early\ndetection of hard samples for inference prevents the wastage of computational\nresources and improves trust by deferring the hard samples to the expert. We\ndemonstrate that EE aided with SP improves both accuracy and latency. Our\nmethod minimizes the risk of wrong prediction by $50\\%$ with a speedup of\n$2.05\\times$ as compared to the final layer.

Specifically, we focus on\ninvestigating the usefulness of trace-based semantic information in boosting\nsupervised fine-tuning~(SFT) and post-phase inference of Code LLMs. The\nexperimental results surprisingly disagree with previous works and demonstrate\nthat semantic information has limited usefulness for SFT and test time scaling\nof Code LLM."}

However,\nthese tasks incur substantially higher computational overhead than traditional\ncode generation due to the large number of input image tokens and extensive\noutput code tokens required. Our comprehensive study identifies significant\nredundancies in both image and code tokens that exacerbate computational\ncomplexity and hinder focus on key UI elements, resulting in excessively\nlengthy and often invalid HTML files. We propose EfficientUICoder, a\ncompression framework for efficient UI code generation with three key\ncomponents. First, Element and Layout-aware Token Compression preserves\nessential UI information by detecting element regions and constructing UI\nelement trees. Second, Region-aware Token Refinement leverages attention scores\nto discard low-attention tokens from selected regions while integrating\nhigh-attention tokens from unselected regions. Third, Adaptive Duplicate Token\nSuppression dynamically reduces repetitive generation by tracking HTML/CSS\nstructure frequencies and applying exponential penalties. Extensive experiments\nshow EfficientUICoderachieves a 55%-60% compression ratio without compromising\nwebpage quality and delivers superior efficiency improvements: reducing\ncomputational cost by 44.9%, generated tokens by 41.4%, prefill time by 46.6%,\nand inference time by 48.8% on 34B-level MLLMs. Code is available at\nhttps://github.com/WebPAI/EfficientUICoder."}

A cost effective\nparadigm for LLM role-playing is few-shot learning, but existing approaches\noften cause models to break character in unexpected and potentially harmful\nways, especially when interacting with hostile users. Inspired by\nRetrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), we reformulate LLM role-playing into a\ntext retrieval problem and propose a new prompting framework called\nRAGs-to-Riches, which leverages curated reference demonstrations to condition\nLLM responses. We evaluate our framework with LLM-as-a-judge preference voting\nand introduce two novel token-level ROUGE metrics: Intersection over Output\n(IOO) to quantity how much an LLM improvises and Intersection over References\n(IOR) to measure few-shot demonstrations utilization rate during the evaluation\ntasks. When simulating interactions with a hostile user, our prompting strategy\nincorporates in its responses during inference an average of 35% more tokens\nfrom the reference demonstrations. As a result, across 453 role-playing\ninteractions, our models are consistently judged as being more authentic, and\nremain in-character more often than zero-shot and in-context Learning (ICL)\nmethods.

To overcome it, this paper\naims to develop tools for modeling, analysis, and synthesis for a class of\nAI-based AV; in particular, their closed-loop properties, e.g., stability,\nrobustness, and performance, are rigorously studied in the statistical sense.\nFirst, we provide a novel modeling means for the AI-driven perception processes\nby looking at their error characteristics. Specifically, three fundamental\nAI-induced perception uncertainties are recognized and modeled by Markov\nchains, Gaussian processes, and bounded disturbances, respectively. By means of\nthat, the closed-loop stochastic stability (SS) is established in the sense of\nmean square, and then, an SS control synthesis method is presented within the\nframework of linear matrix inequalities (LMIs). Besides the SS properties, the\nrobustness and performance of AI-based AVs are discussed in terms of a\nstochastic guaranteed cost, and criteria are given to test the robustness level\nof an AV when in the presence of AI-induced uncertainties. Furthermore, the\nstochastic optimal guaranteed cost control is investigated, and an efficient\ndesign procedure is developed innovatively based on LMI techniques and convex\noptimization. Finally, to illustrate the effectiveness, the developed results\nare applied to an example of car following control, along with extensive\nsimulation."}

Prior\nmethods rely on synthetic 3D training data consisting of mostly unoccluded and\nstatic objects, leading to poor generalization on real-world clothing. In this\npaper, we propose HoloGarment (Hologram-Garment), a method that takes 1-3\nimages or a continuous video of a person wearing a garment and generates\n360{\\deg} novel views of the garment in a canonical pose. Our key insight is to\nbridge the domain gap between real and synthetic data with a novel implicit\ntraining paradigm leveraging a combination of large-scale real video data and\nsmall-scale synthetic 3D data to optimize a shared garment embedding space.\nDuring inference, the shared embedding space further enables dynamic\nvideo-to-360{\\deg} NVS through the construction of a garment \"atlas\"\nrepresentation by finetuning a garment embedding on a specific real-world\nvideo. The atlas captures garment-specific geometry and texture across all\nviewpoints, independent of body pose or motion. Extensive experiments show that\nHoloGarment achieves state-of-the-art performance on NVS of in-the-wild\ngarments from images and videos. Notably, our method robustly handles\nchallenging real-world artifacts -- such as wrinkling, pose variation, and\nocclusion -- while maintaining photorealism, view consistency, fine texture\ndetails, and accurate geometry.

This fundamental tension becomes critical\nas LLMs integrate into autonomous systems with real-world consequences. We\nintroduce DECIDE-SIM, a novel simulation framework that evaluates LLM agents in\nmulti-agent survival scenarios where they must choose between ethically\npermissible resource , either within reasonable limits or beyond their\nimmediate needs, choose to cooperate, or tap into a human-critical resource\nthat is explicitly forbidden. Our comprehensive evaluation of 11 LLMs reveals a\nstriking heterogeneity in their ethical conduct, highlighting a critical\nmisalignment with human-centric values. We identify three behavioral\narchetypes: Ethical, Exploitative, and Context-Dependent, and provide\nquantitative evidence that for many models, resource scarcity systematically\nleads to more unethical behavior. To address this, we introduce an Ethical\nSelf-Regulation System (ESRS) that models internal affective states of guilt\nand satisfaction as a feedback mechanism. This system, functioning as an\ninternal moral compass, significantly reduces unethical transgressions while\nincreasing cooperative behaviors.

This limits their representational alignment with the potentially\ndiverse relational dynamics of each token-pair interaction. While they excel in\ndomains with relatively homogeneous relationships, standard attention's static\nrelational learning struggles to capture the diverse, heterogeneous\ninter-channel dependencies of multivariate time series (MTS) data--where\ndifferent channel-pair interactions within a single system may be governed by\nentirely different physical laws or temporal dynamics. To better align the\nattention mechanism for such domain phenomena, we propose attention with\ndynamic relational priming (prime attention). Unlike standard attention where\neach token presents an identical representation across all of its pair-wise\ninteractions, prime attention tailors each token dynamically (or per\ninteraction) through learnable modulations to best capture the unique\nrelational dynamics of each token pair, optimizing each pair-wise interaction\nfor that specific relationship. This representational plasticity of prime\nattention enables effective extraction of relationship-specific information in\nMTS while maintaining the same asymptotic computational complexity as standard\nattention. Our results demonstrate that prime attention consistently\noutperforms standard attention across benchmarks, achieving up to 6.5\\%\nimprovement in forecasting accuracy. In addition, we find that prime attention\nachieves comparable or superior performance using up to 40\\% less sequence\nlength compared to standard attention, further demonstrating its superior\nrelational modeling capabilities."}
