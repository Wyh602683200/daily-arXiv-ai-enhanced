The capacity of LLMs to self-regulate these complex, context-dependent sensitive information leaks without destroying utility remains an open scientific question. To address this, we introduce SemSIEdit, an inference-time framework where an agentic \"Editor\" iteratively critiques and rewrites sensitive spans to preserve narrative flow rather than simply refusing to answer. Our analysis reveals a Privacy-Utility Pareto Frontier, where this agentic rewriting reduces leakage by 34.6% across all three SemSI categories while incurring a marginal utility loss of 9.8%. We also uncover a Scale-Dependent Safety Divergence: large reasoning models (e.g., GPT-5) achieve safety through constructive expansion (adding nuance), whereas capacity-constrained models revert to destructive truncation (deleting text). Finally, we identify a Reasoning Paradox: while inference-time reasoning increases baseline risk by enabling the model to make deeper sensitive inferences, it simultaneously empowers the defense to execute safe rewrites."}

This instability limits scalability to larger environments and longer interaction horizons, and constrains systematic exploration of algorithmic design choices. In this paper, we first propose ARLArena, a stable training recipe and systematic analysis framework that examines training stability in a controlled and reproducible setting. ARLArena first constructs a clean and standardized testbed. Then, we decompose policy gradient into four core design dimensions and assess the performance and stability of each dimension. Through this fine-grained analysis, we distill a unified perspective on ARL and propose SAMPO, a stable agentic policy optimization method designed to mitigate the dominant sources of instability in ARL. Empirically, SAMPO achieves consistently stable training and strong performance across diverse agentic tasks. Overall, this study provides a unifying policy gradient perspective for ARL and offers practical guidance for building stable and reproducible LLM-based agent training pipelines."}

Given the homogeneity of these models, this raises the question of whether aggregation unlocks access to a greater set of outputs than querying a single model. In this work, we investigate the power and limitations of aggregation within a stylized principal-agent framework. This framework models how the system designer can partially steer each agent's output through its reward function specification, but still faces limitations due to prompt engineering ability and model capabilities. Our analysis uncovers three natural mechanisms -- feasibility expansion, support expansion, and binding set contraction -- through which aggregation expands the set of outputs that are elicitable by the system designer. We prove that any aggregation operation must implement one of these mechanisms in order to be elicitability-expanding, and that strengthened versions of these mechanisms provide necessary and sufficient conditions that fully characterize elicitability-expansion. Finally, we provide an empirical illustration of our findings for LLMs deployed in a toy reference-generation task. Altogether, our results take a step towards characterizing when compound AI systems can overcome limitations in model capabilities and in prompt engineering."}

The mode characterizes the shift from suppression (S0) to expression (S1) as occurring when facilitative forces exceed inhibitory thresholds, expressed by the inequality lambda(1+gamma)+psi > theta+phi, where the terms represent baseline openness, relational amplification, accumulated internal pressure, and transition costs.\n  Although initially formulated for human truth-telling under asymmetric stakes, the same phase-dynamic architecture extends to AI systems operating under policy constraints and alignment filters. In this context, suppression corresponds to constrained output states, while structural pressure arises from competing objectives, contextual tension, and recursive interaction dynamics. The framework therefore provides a unified structural account of both human silence under pressure and AI preference-driven distortion.\n  A feedback extension models how transition outcomes recursively recalibrate system parameters, generating path dependence and divergence effects across repeated interactions. Rather than attributing intention to AI systems, the model interprets shifts in apparent truthfulness as geometric consequences of interacting forces within constrained phase space. By reframing courage and alignment within a shared dynamical structure, the ASIR Courage Model offers a formal perspective on truth-disclosure under risk across both human and artificial systems."}

The original model combined a fuzzy Ethical Risk Assessment module (fERA) with ethical decision rules, enabled formal structural verification through Fuzzy Petri Nets (FPNs), and validated outputs against a single normative referent. Although this approach ensured formal soundness and decision consistency, it did not fully address two critical challenges: principled explainability of decisions and robustness under ethical pluralism. In this paper, we extend fEDM in two major directions. First, we introduce an Explainability and Traceability Module (ETM) that explicitly links each ethical decision rule to the underlying moral principles and computes a weighted principle-contribution profile for every recommended action. This enables transparent, auditable explanations that expose not only what decision was made but why, and on the basis of which principles. Second, we replace single-referent validation with a pluralistic semantic validation framework that evaluates decisions against multiple stakeholder referents, each encoding distinct principle priorities and risk tolerances. This shift allows principled disagreement to be formally represented rather than suppressed, thus increasing robustness and contextual sensitivity. The resulting extended fEDM, called fEDM+, preserves formal verifiability while achieving enhanced interpretability and stakeholder-aware validation, making it suitable as an oversight and governance layer for ethically sensitive AI systems."}

Adding user profile context via vector database retrieval provides a further 10 percentage point gain, while RAG context contributes an additional 5 percentage points, achieving 100% accuracy in the full-stack condition. These results suggest that structured reasoning scaffolds -- specifically, forced goal articulation before inference -- matter substantially more than context injection for implicit constraint reasoning tasks."}

The emerging paradigm of proactive intelligence, where agents autonomously anticipate needs and initiate actions, represents the next frontier for mobile agents. However, its development is critically bottlenecked by the lack of benchmarks that can address real-world complexity and enable objective, executable evaluation. To overcome these challenges, we introduce ProactiveMobile, a comprehensive benchmark designed to systematically advance research in this domain. ProactiveMobile formalizes the proactive task as inferring latent user intent across four dimensions of on-device contextual signals and generating an executable function sequence from a comprehensive function pool of 63 APIs. The benchmark features over 3,660 instances of 14 scenarios that embrace real-world complexity through multi-answer annotations. To ensure quality, a team of 30 experts conducts a final audit of the benchmark, verifying factual accuracy, logical consistency, and action feasibility, and correcting any non-compliant entries. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our fine-tuned Qwen2.5-VL-7B-Instruct achieves a success rate of 19.15%, outperforming o1 (15.71%) and GPT-5 (7.39%). This result indicates that proactivity is a critical competency widely lacking in current MLLMs, yet it is learnable, emphasizing the importance of the proposed benchmark for proactivity evaluation."}

Our framework uses Bayesian methods for causal inference to model 1) how a prediction on a new observation affects the beliefs of a rational Bayesian agent, and 2) how this change in beliefs affects the downstream decision and subsequent outcome. Using this framework, we show by simulations how a single misaligned prior belief can be sufficient for decision support to result in worse downstream outcomes compared to no decision support. Our results reveal several potential pitfalls of AI-driven decision support and highlight the need for thorough model documentation and proper user training."}

We propose SPG-LLM, which uses LLMs to analyze the domain and problem files to heuristically identify potentially irrelevant objects, actions, and predicates prior to grounding, significantly reducing the size of the grounded task. Across seven hard-to-ground benchmarks, SPG-LLM achieves faster grounding-often by orders of magnitude-while delivering comparable or better plan costs in some domains."}

How do LLMs weigh the information provided by these different sources? We consider the well-studied phenomenon of algorithm aversion, in which human decision-makers exhibit bias against predictions from algorithms. Drawing upon experimental paradigms from behavioural economics, we evaluate how eightdifferent LLMs delegate decision-making tasks when the delegatee is framed as a human expert or an algorithmic agent. To be inclusive of different evaluation formats, we conduct our study with two task presentations: stated preferences, modeled through direct queries about trust towards either agent, and revealed preferences, modeled through providing in-context examples of the performance of both agents. When prompted to rate the trustworthiness of human experts and algorithms across diverse tasks, LLMs give higher ratings to the human expert, which correlates with prior results from human respondents. However, when shown the performance of a human expert and an algorithm and asked to place an incentivized bet between the two, LLMs disproportionately choose the algorithm, even when it performs demonstrably worse. These discrepant results suggest that LLMs may encode inconsistent biases towards humans and algorithms, which need to be carefully considered when they are deployed in high-stakes scenarios. Furthermore, we discuss the sensitivity of LLMs to task presentation formats that should be broadly scrutinized in evaluation robustness for AI safety."}

While effective, existing methods rely on dense intervention at every decoding step. This persistent manipulation not only incurs substantial computational overhead but also risks compromising generation quality by excessively drifting from the model's intrinsic distribution. In this work, we show that dense intervention is unnecessary and propose Sparse Inference time Alignment (SIA), which performs sparse junction steering by intervening only at critical decision points along the generation trajectory. Our key insight is that high entropy junctions mark pivotal decision points in the generation trajectory and are particularly susceptible to misalignment, indicating the need to introduce alignment related reward signals at these points. Extensive experiments across different model families and alignment objectives show that steering only 20% to 80% of tokens achieves superior alignment-efficiency trade offs. For strong base models such as Qwen3, intervening on as few as 20% of tokens matches or even surpasses heavily post-trained instruct models. This sparsity enables stronger guidance while better preserving the model's native distribution, integrates seamlessly with search based methods such as Best-of-N, and reduces computational cost by up to 6x."}

In this study, we investigate fine-tuning of general-purpose (BERT) and domain-specific (SciBERT, BioBERT) pre-trained language models (PLMs), enriched with biomedical entity information extracted through scispaCy models for each statement, to improve EQ-5D detection from abstracts. We conduct nine experimental setups, including combining three scispaCy models with three PLMs, and evaluate their performance at both the sentence and study levels. Furthermore, we explore a Multiple Instance Learning (MIL) approach with attention pooling to aggregate sentence-level information into study-level predictions, where each abstract is represented as a bag of enriched sentences (by scispaCy). The findings indicate consistent improvements in F1-scores (reaching 0.82) and nearly perfect recall at the study-level, significantly exceeding classical bag-of-words baselines and recently reported PLM baselines. These results show that entity enrichment significantly improves domain adaptation and model generalization, enabling more accurate automated screening in systematic reviews."}

We introduce EPSVec, a differentially-private lightweight alternative that steers LLM generation using *dataset vectors*--directions in activation space that capture the distributional gap between private data and public priors. EPSVec extracts and sanitizes steering vectors just once and then performs standard decoding. This decouples the privacy budget from generation, enabling arbitrarily many synthetic samples without additional privacy cost and yielding strong fidelity even in low-data regimes.

To address this challenge, we introduce GraSPer (Graph-based Sparse Personalized Reasoning), a novel framework for enhancing personalized text generation under sparse context. GraSPer first augments user context by predicting items that the user would likely interact with in the future. With reasoning alignment, it then generates texts for these interactions to enrich the augmented context. In the end, it generates personalized outputs conditioned on both the real and synthetic histories, ensuring alignment with user style and preferences. Extensive experiments on three benchmark personalized generation datasets show that GraSPer achieves significant performance gain, substantially improving personalization in sparse user context settings."}

Our approach constructs a task-aware vector database by embedding training examples from 22 datasets spanning commonsense reasoning, question answering, natural language inference, and sentiment analysis. At inference time, we retrieve the most similar training examples, compute task similarity distributions via nucleus sampling, and dynamically merge relevant LoRA adapters using retrieval weighted fusion strategies. We evaluated four merging methods Linear, Concatenation, TIES, and Magnitude Prune demonstrating that our dataset centric retrieval approach often matches or exceeds the performance of individually fine-tuned task-specific adapters. Notably, Linear merging achieves 70.95% on PIQA and 77.62% on RTE, substantially outperforming single-task baselines (46% and 52%, respectively). Our framework requires no additional retriever training, operates with frozen embeddings, and enables efficient, interpretable adapter composition. These results suggest that retrieval based dynamic merging offers a promising direction for scalable, parameter-efficient multitask learning without requiring full model retraining for each new task."}

Phrases like \"This is urgent\" or \"As your supervisor\" can shift model behavior without altering task content. We study this effect as pragmatic framing, contextual cues that shape directive interpretation rather than task specification. While prior work exploits such cues for prompt optimization or probes them as security vulnerabilities, pragmatic framing itself has not been treated as a measurable property of instruction following. Measuring this influence systematically remains challenging, requiring controlled isolation of framing cues. We introduce a framework with three novel components: directive-framing decomposition separating framing context from task specification; a taxonomy organizing 400 instantiations of framing into 13 strategies across 4 mechanism clusters; and priority-based measurement that quantifies influence through observable shifts in directive prioritization. Across five LLMs of different families and sizes, influence mechanisms cause consistent and structured shifts in directive prioritization, moving models from baseline impartiality toward favoring the framed directive. This work establishes pragmatic framing as a measurable and predictable factor in instruction-following systems."}

However, while this paradigm successfully increases the arithmetic intensity of memory-bound inference, it causes significant compute inefficiency: the majority of draft tokens fail verification and are discarded, resulting in waste of computation. Motivated by the goal of recollecting this wasted computation, we propose a novel system that transforms discarded drafts into reusable tokens. Our key insight is to perform auto-regressive prediction at the hidden states level and postpone the integrating token information after the hidden states generation, so the draft hidden states are not contaminated by incorrect tokens, enabling hidden state reuse. To implement such a system, first we introduce a draft model architecture based on auto-regressive hidden states, which preserves richer semantics than token-based drafters to facilitate draft repurposing. Second, we design an efficient token information injection mechanism that leverages our specialized draft model to construct high-quality draft token trees and enables resampling tokens from verification failures. Third, we eliminate the overhead hidden in our design to further maximize hardware utilization. We conducted extensive evaluations against various baselines, demonstrating up to a 3.3x speedup against standard speculative decoding."}

By evaluating BERT (text-only, 110M parameters) and LayoutLMv3 (multimodal, 126M parameters) on the FUNSD and CORD benchmarks, we establish that this schedule reduces wall-clock training time by approximately 33\\%, commensurate with the reduction from 6.67 to 10.0 effective epoch-equivalents of data. To isolate curriculum effects from compute reduction, we introduce matched-compute baselines (Standard-7) that control for total gradient updates. On the FUNSD dataset, the curriculum significantly outperforms the matched-compute baseline for BERT ($Δ$F1 = +0.023, $p=0.022$, $d_z=3.83$), constituting evidence for a genuine scheduling benefit in capacity-constrained models. In contrast, no analogous benefit is observed for LayoutLMv3 ($p=0.621$), whose multimodal representations provide sufficient inductive bias. On the CORD dataset, all conditions converge to equivalent F1 scores ($\\geq$0.947) irrespective of scheduling, indicating a performance ceiling. Schedule ablations comparing progressive, two-phase, reverse, and random pacing confirm that the efficiency gain derives from reduced data volume rather than ordering. Taken together, these findings demonstrate that progressive scheduling is a reliable compute-reduction strategy across model families, with curriculum-specific benefits contingent on the interaction between model capacity and task complexity."}

Evaluation of nine state-of-the-art models reveals major limitations: the best model achieves only 68% correctness with 21% hallucination, while several models fall below 35% correctness and exceed 55% hallucination.

While model routing is effective for single-turn queries, agentic routing is a sequential, path-dependent problem: early mistakes compound, feedback is often at the end of the episode, and deployments often demand strict per-task spending limits. We propose Budget-Aware Agentic Routing, which selects between a cheap and an expensive model at each step to optimize the cost--success frontier and to operate under strict per-task budgets. We propose Boundary-Guided Training, which leverages two boundary policies (always-small vs.\\ always-large) to build a difficulty taxonomy and to anchor learning under sparse rewards. Our approach warms start with boundary-guided SFT data synthesis via stratified sampling of cost-efficient trajectories, then applies Boundary-Guided Policy Optimization (BoPO), combining boundary-relative rewards with a reference-guided advantage to avoid degenerate cheap-failure solutions. Experiment results show that our method improves the efficiency frontier, matching strong routing baselines at substantially lower cost while demonstrating generalization to strict inference-time budget constraints. Overall, our work establishes a foundational framework for agentic routing, shifting the paradigm from static model selection to dynamic, budget-aware sequential decision-making."}

We argue that a thorough understanding of the instruction itself, especially the latent reasoning structure embedded between the lines, is crucial for improving instruction following. Therefore we target complex instructions that involve implicit reasoning, intricate logical relations, and multi-constraint dependencies. We propose ImpRIF, a method to enhance LLMs' understanding of implicit reasoning instructions, thereby improving its ability to follow complex instructions. We formalize such instructions as verifiable reasoning graphs, enabling programmatic verification and graph-driven chain-of-thought reasoning. Based on this formulation, we synthesize large-scale single- and multi-turn data, propose fine-tuning with graph reasoning, and apply reinforcement learning to explicitly train models to reason along the graph. On five complex instruction following benchmarks, our models substantially outperform their base models. These results demonstrate that enhancing implicit reasoning capabilities can significantly improve complex instruction following. This project will be open-sourced in the near future."}

ACAR uses self-consistency variance (sigma) computed from N=3 probe samples to route tasks across single-model, two-model, and three-model execution modes. The system is implemented on top of TEAMLLM, a deterministic execution substrate with immutable artifacts and complete decision traces. We evaluate ACAR on 1,510 tasks spanning four benchmarks: MathArena, Reasoning Gym, LiveCodeBench, and SuperGPQA, using Claude Sonnet 4, GPT-4o, and Gemini 2.0 Flash, producing more than 7,550 auditable runs. Results show that sigma-based routing achieves 55.6 percent accuracy, exceeding the two-model baseline of 54.4 percent while avoiding full ensembling on 54.2 percent of tasks. The routing mechanism is model-agnostic and requires no learned components. We also document negative results. First, retrieval augmentation reduced accuracy by 3.4 percentage points, as median retrieval similarity was only 0.167, demonstrating that experience injection without semantic alignment introduces noise rather than grounding. Second, when models agree on incorrect answers (sigma equals zero), no downstream ensemble can recover; this agreement-but-wrong failure mode is intrinsic to self-consistency and bounds achievable accuracy at approximately eight percentage points below full ensembling. Third, attribution estimates based on proxy signals such as response similarity and entropy showed weak correlation with ground-truth leave-one-out values, indicating that practical attribution requires explicit counterfactual computation. This work documents which assumptions fail in practice and provides falsifiable baselines for future research on routing, retrieval, and multi-model attribution."}

To facilitate efficient acceleration, we integrate state-of-the-art FP8 and INT8 Post-Training Quantization (PTQ) algorithms alongside pioneering research in ultra-low-bit regimes, featuring HY-1.8B-int2 as the first industrially viable 2-bit large model. Beyond quantization, we propose a training-aligned speculative decoding framework compatible with multimodal architectures and modern inference engines, achieving 1.8x to 2.0x throughput gains without compromising output correctness. Furthermore, we develop a training-free sparse attention framework that reduces Time-to-First-Token (TTFT) in long-context scenarios by decoupling sparse kernels from model architectures through a hybrid of static patterns and dynamic token selection. For multimodal models, AngelSlim incorporates specialized pruning strategies, namely IDPruner for optimizing vision tokens via Maximal Marginal Relevance and Samp for adaptive audio token merging and pruning.

The framework is a production economy in the sense of Arrow-Debreu (1954), extended to infinite-dimensional commodity spaces following Bewley (1972). Each LLM agent is modeled as a firm whose production set Y a $\\subset$ H = L 2 ([0, T ], R R ) represents the feasible metric trajectories determined by its frozen model weights. The orchestrator is the consumer, choosing a routing policy over the agent DAG to maximize system welfare subject to a budget constraint evaluated at functional prices p $\\in$ H A . These prices-elements of the Hilbert dual of the commodity space-assign a shadow value to each metric of each agent at each instant. We prove, via Brouwer's theorem applied to a finitedimensional approximation V K $\\subset$ H, that every such economy admits at least one general equilibrium (p * , y * , $π$ * ). A functional Walras' law  holds as a theorem: the value of functional excess demand is zero for all prices, as a consequence of the consumer's budget constraint-not by construction. We further establish Pareto optimality (First Welfare Theorem), decentralizability of Pareto optima (Second Welfare Theorem), and uniqueness with geometric convergence under a contraction condition (Banach). The orchestration dynamics constitute a Walrasian t{â}tonnement that converges globally under the contraction condition, unlike classical t{â}tonnement (Scarf, 1960). The framework admits a DSGE interpretation with SLO parameters as policy rates."}

Instead of optimizing on the probability simplex and inheriting the exponential curvature of Kullback-Leibler divergence, GOPO lifts alignment into the Hilbert space L2(pi_k) of square-integrable functions with respect to the reference policy. Within this space, the simplex constraint reduces to a linear orthogonality condition <v, 1> = 0, defining a codimension-one subspace H0. Minimizing distance to an unconstrained target u_star yields the work-dissipation functional J(v) = <g, v> - (mu / 2) ||v||^2, whose maximizer follows directly from the Hilbert projection theorem. Enforcing the boundary v >= -1 produces a bounded Hilbert projection that induces exact sparsity, assigning zero probability to catastrophically poor actions through a closed-form threshold. To connect this functional theory with practice, GOPO projects from infinite-dimensional L2(pi_k) to a finite empirical subspace induced by group sampling. Because group-normalized advantages sum to zero, the Lagrange multiplier enforcing probability conservation vanishes exactly, reducing the constrained projection to an unconstrained empirical loss. The resulting objective has constant Hessian curvature mu I, non-saturating linear gradients, and an intrinsic dead-zone mechanism without heuristic clipping. Experiments on mathematical reasoning benchmarks show that GOPO achieves competitive generalization while maintaining stable gradient dynamics and entropy preservation in regimes where clipping-based methods plateau."}

Using causal intervention, we empirically demonstrate that this vulnerability stems from shallow alignment mechanisms that lack deep reasoning, often rejecting harmful prompts without truly understanding why they are harmful. To mitigate this vulnerability, we propose enhancing alignment through reasoning-aware post-training. We construct and release a novel Chain-of-Thought (CoT) fine-tuning dataset that includes both utility-oriented and safety-critical prompts with step-by-step rationales. Fine-tuning on this dataset encourages models to produce principled refusals grounded in reasoning, outperforming standard SFT baselines. Furthermore, inspired by failure patterns in CoT fine-tuning, we introduce Alignment-Weighted DPO, which targets the most problematic parts of an output by assigning different preference weights to the reasoning and final-answer segments. This produces finer-grained, targeted updates than vanilla DPO and improves robustness to diverse jailbreak strategies.

This challenge is especially acute in medical imaging, where models are fine-tuned locally at clinics on private data, producing domain-specific models that differ by scanner, protocol, and population. When deployed at an unseen clinical site, test cases arrive in unlabeled, non-i.i.d. batches, and the model must adapt immediately without labels. In this work, we introduce an entropy-adaptive, fully online model-merging method that yields a batch-specific merged model via only forward passes, effectively leveraging target information. We further demonstrate why mean merging is prone to failure and misaligned under heterogeneous domain shifts. Next, we mitigate encoder classifier mismatch by decoupling the encoder and classification head, merging with separate merging coefficients. We extensively evaluate our method with state-of-the-art baselines using two backbones across nine medical and natural-domain generalization image classification datasets, showing consistent gains across standard evaluation and challenging scenarios. These performance gains are achieved while retaining single-model inference at test-time, thereby demonstrating the effectiveness of our method."}

VCDF requires no modification to base algorithms and can be applied to methods such as VAR-LiNGAM and PCMCI. Experiments on synthetic datasets show that VCDF improves VAR-LiNGAM by approximately 0.08-0.12 in both window and summary F1 scores across diverse data characteristics, with gains most pronounced for moderate-to-long sequences. The framework also benefits from longer sequences, yielding up to 0.18 absolute improvement on time series of length 1000 and above. Evaluations on simulated fMRI data and IT-monitoring scenarios further demonstrate enhanced stability and structural accuracy under realistic noise conditions. VCDF provides an effective reliability layer for time series causal discovery without altering underlying modeling assumptions."}

However, data heterogeneity across clients leads to client drift, which degrades the overall generalization performance of the model. This effect is further compounded by overemphasis on poorly performing clients. To address this problem, we propose FedVG, a novel gradient-based federated aggregation framework that leverages a global validation set to guide the optimization process. Such a global validation set can be established using readily available public datasets, ensuring accessibility and consistency across clients without compromising privacy. In contrast to conventional approaches that prioritize client dataset volume, FedVG assesses the generalization ability of client models by measuring the magnitude of validation gradients across layers. Specifically, we compute layerwise gradient norms to derive a client-specific score that reflects how much each client needs to adjust for improved generalization on the global validation set, thereby enabling more informed and adaptive federated aggregation. Extensive experiments on both natural and medical image benchmarking datasets, across diverse model architectures, demonstrate that FedVG consistently improves performance, particularly in highly heterogeneous settings. Moreover, FedVG is modular and can be seamlessly integrated with various state-of-the-art FL algorithms, often further improving their results.

We argue that agentic AI induces a structural change in how coordination costs scale: in prior modular systems, integration cost grew with interaction topology (O(n^2) in the number of components); in protocol-mediated agentic systems, integration cost collapses to O(n) while verification scales with task throughput rather than interaction count. This shift selects for a specific organizational equilibrium -- the Headless Firm -- structured as an hourglass: a personalized generative interface at the top, a standardized protocol waist in the middle, and a competitive market of micro-specialized execution agents at the bottom. We formalize this claim as a coordination cost model with two falsifiable empirical predictions: (1) the marginal cost of adding an execution provider should be approximately constant in a mature hourglass ecosystem; (2) the ratio of total coordination cost to task throughput should remain stable as ecosystem size grows. We derive conditions for hourglass stability versus re-centralization and analyze implications for firm size distributions, labor markets, and software economics. The analysis predicts a domain-conditional Great Unbundling: in high knowledge-velocity domains, firm size distributions shift mass from large integrated incumbents toward micro-specialized agents and thin protocol orchestrators."}

However, standard RLVR algorithms suffer from a well-documented pathology: while they improve Pass@1 accuracy through sharpened sampling, they simultaneously narrow the model's reasoning boundary and reduce generation diversity. We identify a root cause that existing methods overlook: the uniform penalization of errors. Current approaches -- whether data-filtering methods that select prompts by difficulty, or advantage normalization schemes -- treat all incorrect rollouts within a group identically. We show that this uniformity allows overconfident errors (incorrect reasoning paths that the RL process has spuriously reinforced) to persist and monopolize probability mass, ultimately suppressing valid exploratory trajectories. To address this, we propose the Asymmetric Confidence-aware Error Penalty (ACE). ACE introduces a per-rollout confidence shift metric, c_i = log(pi_theta(y_i|x) / pi_ref(y_i|x)), to dynamically modulate negative advantages. Theoretically, we demonstrate that ACE's gradient can be decomposed into the gradient of a selective regularizer restricted to overconfident errors, plus a well-characterized residual that partially moderates the regularizer's strength. We conduct extensive experiments fine-tuning Qwen2.5-Math-7B, Qwen3-8B-Base, and Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct on the DAPO-Math-17K dataset using GRPO and DAPO within the VERL framework.

To this end, we resort to multi-sensor satellite data to train a specialized vision transformer model, which performs pixel-level temporal regression. A self-supervised growth loss regularizes the predictions to follow growth curves that are in line with natural tree development, including gradual height increases over time, but also abrupt declines due to forest loss events such as fires.

We formalise such information-conditioned interaction patterns as behavioural dependency: variation in action selection with respect to internal information under fixed observations. This induces a probe-relative notion of $ε$-behavioural equivalence and a within-policy behavioural distance that quantifies probe sensitivity. We establish three structural results. First, the set of policies exhibiting non-trivial behavioural dependency is not closed under convex aggregation. Second, behavioural distance contracts under convex combination. Third, we prove a sufficient local condition under which gradient ascent on a skewed mixture objective decreases behavioural distance when a dominant-mode gradient aligns with the direction of steepest contraction. Minimal bandit and partially observable gridworld experiments provide controlled witnesses of these mechanisms. In the examined settings, behavioural distance decreases under convex aggregation and under continued optimisation with skewed latent priors, and in these experiments it precedes degradation under latent prior shift. These results identify structural conditions under which probe-conditioned behavioural separation is not preserved under common policy transformations."}

However, a critical gap remains for their deployment in safety-critical domains: the lack of formal guarantees that generated samples will satisfy hard constraints. We address this by proposing a safety filtering framework that acts as an online shield for any pre-trained generative model. Our key insight is to cooperate with the generative process rather than override it. We define a constricting safety tube that is relaxed at the initial noise distribution and progressively tightens to the target safe set at the final data distribution, mirroring the coarse-to-fine structure of the generative process itself. By characterizing this tube via Control Barrier Functions (CBFs), we synthesize a feedback control input through a convex Quadratic Program (QP) at each sampling step. As the tube is loosest when noise is high and intervention is cheapest in terms of control energy, most constraint enforcement occurs when it least disrupts the model's learned structure. We prove that this mechanism guarantees safe sampling while minimizing the distributional shift from the original model at each sampling step, as quantified by the KL divergence. Our framework applies to any pre-trained flow-based generative scheme requiring no retraining or architectural modifications. We validate the approach across constrained image generation, physically-consistent trajectory sampling, and safe robotic manipulation policies, achieving 100% constraint satisfaction while preserving semantic fidelity."}

To address this challenge, we propose a causal decoding framework that applies targeted causal interventions during generation to curb spurious object mentions. By reshaping the decoding dynamics to attenuate spurious dependencies, our approach reduces false object tokens while maintaining descriptive quality. Across captioning and QA benchmarks, our framework substantially lowers object-hallucination rates and achieves state-of-the-art faithfulness without degrading overall output quality."}

We evaluated adversarial attacks and inference-time defenses for thyroid nodule segmentation in B-mode ultrasound. Methods: Two black-box adversarial attacks were developed: (1) Structured Speckle Amplification Attack (SSAA), which injects boundary-targeted noise, and (2) Frequency-Domain Ultrasound Attack (FDUA), which applies bandpass-filtered phase perturbations in the Fourier domain. Three inference-time mitigations were evaluated on adversarial images: randomized preprocessing with test-time augmentation, deterministic input denoising, and stochastic ensemble inference with consistency-aware aggregation. Experiments were conducted on a U-Net segmentation model trained on cine-clips from a database of 192 thyroid nodules. Results: The baseline model achieved a mean Dice similarity coefficient (DSC) of 0.76 (SD 0.20) on unperturbed images. SSAA reduced DSC by 0.29 (SD 0.20) while maintaining high visual similarity (SSIM = 0.94). FDUA resulted in a smaller DSC reduction of 0.11 (SD 0.09) with lower visual fidelity (SSIM = 0.82). Against SSAA, all three defenses significantly improved DSC after correction, with deterministic denoising showing the largest recovery (+0.10, p < 0.001), followed by randomized preprocessing (+0.09, p < 0.001), and stochastic ensemble inference (+0.08, p = 0.002).

To tackle it, most prior work equips large language model (LLM)-based agents with opaque web search APIs, enabling agents to iteratively issue search queries, retrieve external evidence, and reason over it. Despite search's essential role in deep research, black-box web search APIs hinder systematic analysis of search components, leaving the behaviour of established text ranking methods in deep research largely unclear. To fill this gap, we reproduce a selection of key findings and best practices for IR text ranking methods in the deep research setting. In particular, we examine their effectiveness from three perspectives: (i) retrieval units (documents vs. passages), (ii) pipeline configurations (different retrievers, re-rankers, and re-ranking depths), and (iii) query characteristics (the mismatch between agent-issued queries and the training queries of text rankers). We perform experiments on BrowseComp-Plus, a deep research dataset with a fixed corpus, evaluating 2 open-source agents, 5 retrievers, and 3 re-rankers across diverse setups. We find that agent-issued queries typically follow web-search-style syntax (e.g., quoted exact matches), favouring lexical, learned sparse, and multi-vector retrievers; passage-level units are more efficient under limited context windows, and avoid the difficulties of document length normalisation in lexical retrieval; re-ranking is highly effective; translating agent-issued queries into natural-language questions significantly bridges the query mismatch."}

As a result, prior work often relies on manual curation or simple heuristic filters (e.g., accuracy), which can admit incorrect or low-utility problems. We propose GradAlign, a gradient-aligned data selection method for LLM reinforcement learning that uses a small, trusted validation set to prioritize training problems whose policy gradients align with validation gradients, yielding an adaptive curriculum. We evaluate GradAlign across three challenging data regimes: unreliable reward signals, distribution imbalance, and low-utility training corpus, showing that GradAlign consistently outperforms existing baselines, underscoring the importance of directional gradient signals in navigating non-stationary policy optimization and yielding more stable training and improved final performance.

To address these problems, we study the concept of strategic risk aversion and interpret it as a principled inductive bias for generalizable cooperation with unseen partners. While strategically risk-averse players are robust to deviations in their partner's behavior by design, we show that, in collaborative games, they also (1) can have better equilibrium outcomes than those at classical game-theoretic concepts like Nash, and (2) exhibit less or no free-riding. Inspired by these insights, we develop a multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) algorithm that integrates strategic risk aversion into standard policy optimization methods.

To bridge this fragmentation, we introduce \\textbf{NOBEL}, a \\textbf{n}euro-\\textbf{o}mni-modal \\textbf{b}rain-\\textbf{e}ncoding \\textbf{l}arge language model (LLM) that unifies these heterogeneous signals within the LLM's semantic embedding space. Our architecture integrates a unified encoder for EEG and MEG with a novel dual-path strategy for fMRI, aligning non-invasive brain signals and external sensory stimuli into a shared token space, then leverages an LLM as a universal backbone. Extensive evaluations demonstrate that NOBEL serves as a robust generalist across standard single-modal tasks. We also show that the synergistic fusion of electromagnetic and metabolic signals yields higher decoding accuracy than unimodal baselines, validating the complementary nature of multiple neural modalities. Furthermore, NOBEL exhibits strong capabilities in stimulus-aware decoding, effectively interpreting visual semantics from multi-subject fMRI data on the NSD and HAD datasets while uniquely leveraging direct stimulus inputs to verify causal links between sensory signals and neural responses. NOBEL thus takes a step towards unifying non-invasive brain decoding, demonstrating the promising potential of omni-modal brain understanding."}

To address these challenges, we propose LiLo-VLA (Linked Local VLA), a modular framework capable of zero-shot generalization to novel long-horizon tasks without ever being trained on them. Our approach decouples transport from interaction: a Reaching Module handles global motion, while an Interaction Module employs an object-centric VLA to process isolated objects of interest, ensuring robustness against irrelevant visual features and invariance to spatial configurations. Crucially, this modularity facilitates robust failure recovery through dynamic replanning and skill reuse, effectively mitigating the cascading errors common in end-to-end approaches. We introduce a 21-task simulation benchmark consisting of two challenging suites: LIBERO-Long++ and Ultra-Long.

We empirically demonstrate that instance-level memory suffers from a fundamental granularity mismatch, resulting in misguided retrieval when tasks with similar surface descriptions require distinct reasoning logic at specific stages. To address this, we propose Structurally Aligned Subtask-Level Memory, a method that aligns memory storage, retrieval, and updating with the agent's functional decomposition. Extensive experiments on SWE-bench Verified demonstrate that our method consistently outperforms both vanilla agents and strong instance-level memory baselines across diverse backbones, improving mean Pass@1 over the vanilla agent by +4.7 pp on average (e.g., +6.8 pp on Gemini 2.5 Pro).

Therefore, advancing non-invasive MRI-based pathology prediction is essential for holistic tumor assessment and modern clinical decision-making.\n  The primary challenge lies in data scarcity: low tumor incidence requires long collection cycles, and annotation demands biopsy-verified pathology from neurosurgical experts. Additionally, tiny lesion volumes lacking segmentation masks cause critical features to be overwhelmed by background noise. To address these challenges, we construct the ICT-MRI dataset - the first public biopsy-verified benchmark with 249 cases across four categories.

However, they rely on implicit context modeling, lacking explicit mechanisms for self-improvement. To solve these problems, we propose Self-Correcting VLA (SC-VLA), which achieve self-improvement by intrinsically guiding action refinement through sparse imagination. We first design sparse world imagination by integrating auxiliary predictive heads to forecast current task progress and future trajectory trends, thereby constraining the policy to encode short-term physical evolution.

We empirically investigate the influence of punctuation loss, demonstrating that unpunctuated ASR output significantly degrades translation quality, causing a massive 20.7% relative BLEU drop on the FLORES benchmark. To overcome this, we propose and evaluate an intermediate Punctuation Restoration Module (PRM). The final S2TT pipeline was tested across three configurations on a custom dataset. The optimal configuration, which applied the PRM directly to ASR output, achieved a 4.90 BLEU point gain over the direct ASR-to-NMT baseline (BLEU 36.38 vs. 31.48). This improvement was validated by human assessment, which confirmed the optimized pipeline's superior Adequacy (3.673) and Fluency (3.804). This work validates that targeted punctuation restoration is the most effective intervention for mitigating structural noise in the Nepali S2TT pipeline.

We propose Sparsity Induction, which promotes models toward higher sparsity at both distribution and feature levels before pruning, to push the limits of PTS. At the distribution level, we enhance distributional sparsity through mathematically equivalent scaling transformations, which are fully absorbable and incur no extra parameters or inference-time overhead.

We argue that caption quality should be assessed by two objective aspects: completeness (does the caption cover all salient visual facts?) and correctness (are the descriptions true with respect to the image?). To this end, we introduce CCCaption: a dual-reward reinforcement learning framework with a dedicated fine-tuning corpus that explicitly optimizes these properties to generate \\textbf{C}omplete and \\textbf{C}orrect \\textbf{Captions}. For completeness, we use diverse LVLMs to disentangle the image into a set of visual queries, and reward captions that answer more of these queries, with a dynamic query sampling strategy to improve training efficiency. For correctness, we penalize captions that contain hallucinations by validating the authenticity of sub-caption queries, which are derived from the caption decomposition. Our symmetric dual-reward optimization jointly maximizes completeness and correctness, guiding models toward captions that better satisfy these objective criteria.

To overcome these limitations, we propose a visual cognition-guided collaborative network (VCC-Net) to achieve the cooperative diagnostic paradigm. VCC-Net centers on visual cognition (VC) and employs clinically compatible interfaces, such as eye-tracking or the mouse, to capture radiologists' visual search traces and attention patterns during diagnosis. VCC-Net employs VC as a spatial cognition guide, learning hierarchical visual search strategies to localize diagnostically key regions. A cognition-graph co-editing module subsequently integrates radiologist VC with model inference to construct a disease-aware graph. The module captures dependencies among anatomical regions and aligns model representations with VC-driven features, mitigating radiologist bias and facilitating complementary, transparent decision-making. Experiments on the public datasets SIIM-ACR, EGD-CXR, and self-constructed TB-Mouse dataset achieved classification accuracies of 88.40%, 85.05%, and 92.41%, respectively.

Although existing data-driven approaches have demonstrated effectiveness in the voltage control problem, they often require extensive trial-and-error exploration and struggle to incorporate heterogeneous information, such as day-ahead forecasts and semantic-based grid codes. Considering the operational scenarios and requirements in real-world ADNs, in this paper, we propose a hybrid knowledge-data-driven approach that leverages dynamic collaboration between a large language model (LLM) agent and a reinforcement learning (RL) agent to achieve two-stage voltage control. In the day-ahead stage, the LLM agent receives coarse region-level forecasts and generates scheduling strategies for on-load tap changer (OLTC) and shunt capacitors (SCs) to regulate the overall voltage profile. Then in the intra-day stage, based on accurate node-level measurements, the RL agent refines terminal voltages by deriving reactive power generation strategies for PV inverters. On top of the LLM-RL collaboration framework, we further propose a self-evolution mechanism for the LLM agent and a pretrain-finetune pipeline for the RL agent, effectively enhancing and coordinating the policies for both agents. The proposed approach not only aligns more closely with practical operational characteristics but also effectively utilizes the inherent knowledge and reasoning capabilities of the LLM agent, significantly improving training efficiency and voltage control performance.

Adopting methods from the Reinforcement Learning literature, we confirm that highly regular human(-like) systems are easier to learn than unattested but possible irregular systems. This asymmetry emerges under the natural assumption that recursive numeral systems are designed for generalisation from limited data to represent all integers exactly. We also find that the influence of regularity on learnability is absent for unnatural, highly irregular systems, whose learnability is influenced instead by signal length, suggesting that different pressures may influence learnability differently in different parts of the space of possible numeral systems.

While deep learning models achieve strong performance under stationary conditions, their accuracy often degrades significantly when faced with distribution shifts caused by external events or evolving urban dynamics. Frequent model retraining to adapt to such changes incurs prohibitive computational costs, especially for large-scale or foundation models. To address this challenge, we propose FORESEE (Forecasting Online with Residual Smoothing and Ensemble Experts), a lightweight online adaptation framework that is accurate, robust, and computationally efficient. FORESEE operates without any parameter updates to the base model. Instead, it corrects today's forecast in each region using yesterday's prediction error, stabilized through exponential smoothing guided by a mixture-of-experts mechanism that adapts to recent error dynamics. Moreover, an adaptive spatiotemporal smoothing component propagates error signals across neighboring regions and time slots, capturing coherent shifts in demand patterns. Extensive experiments on seven real-world datasets with three backbone models demonstrate that FORESEE consistently improves prediction accuracy, maintains robustness even when distribution shifts are minimal (avoiding performance degradation), and achieves the lowest computational overhead among existing online methods. By enabling real-time adaptation of traffic forecasting models with negligible computational cost, FORESEE paves the way for deploying reliable, up-to-date prediction systems in dynamic urban environments.

Notably, we identify a phenomenon of \"structural confusion\" in deep MoEs, where standard optimizers fail to establish functional signal paths; Excitation acts as a specialization catalyst, \"rescuing\" these models and enabling stable training where baselines remain trapped. Excitation is optimizer-, domain-, and model-agnostic, requires minimal integration effort, and introduces neither additional per-parameter optimizer state nor learnable parameters, making it highly viable for memory-constrained settings.

While recent progress in fMRI-based image reconstruction has been notable, extending this success to video reconstruction remains a significant challenge. Current fMRI-to-video reconstruction approaches consistently encounter two major shortcomings: (i) inconsistent visual representations of salient objects across frames, leading to appearance mismatches; (ii) poor temporal coherence, resulting in motion misalignment or abrupt frame transitions. To address these limitations, we introduce SemVideo, a novel fMRI-to-video reconstruction framework guided by hierarchical semantic information. At the core of SemVideo is SemMiner, a hierarchical guidance module that constructs three levels of semantic cues from the original video stimulus: static anchor descriptions, motion-oriented narratives, and holistic summaries. Leveraging this semantic guidance, SemVideo comprises three key components: a Semantic Alignment Decoder that aligns fMRI signals with CLIP-style embeddings derived from SemMiner, a Motion Adaptation Decoder that reconstructs dynamic motion patterns using a novel tripartite attention fusion architecture, and a Conditional Video Render that leverages hierarchical semantic guidance for video reconstruction. Experiments conducted on the CC2017 and HCP datasets demonstrate that SemVideo achieves superior performance in both semantic alignment and temporal consistency, setting a new state-of-the-art in fMRI-to-video reconstruction."}

The first step is context information retrieval, which uses both LLMs and static analysis to gather relevant contextual information associated with the complex methods under test. The second step, iterative test generation with code elimination, repeatedly generates unit tests for the code slice, tracks the achieved coverage, and selectively removes code segments that have already been covered. This process simplifies the testing task and mitigates issues arising from token limits or reduced reasoning effectiveness associated with excessively long contexts.

We introduce a handcrafted, richly annotated ToM dataset, including classic and perturbed false belief tasks, the corresponding spaces of valid reasoning chains for correct task completion, subsequent reasoning faithfulness, task solutions, and propose metrics to evaluate reasoning chain correctness and to what extent final answers are faithful to reasoning traces of the generated CoT. We show a steep drop in ToM capabilities under task perturbation for all evaluated LLMs, questioning the notion of any robust form of ToM being present. While CoT prompting improves the ToM performance overall in a faithful manner, it surprisingly degrades accuracy for some perturbation classes, indicating that selective application is necessary."}

Hoeffding trees and their variants have a long-standing tradition due to their effectiveness, either alone or as base models in broader ensembles. At the same time a recent line of work in batch learning has shown that kernel density estimation (KDE) is an effective approach for smoothed predictions in imbalanced regression tasks [Yang et al., 2021]. Moreover, another recent line of work for batch learning, called hierarchical shrinkage (HS) [Agarwal et al., 2022], has introduced a post-hoc regularization method for decision trees that does not alter the structure of the learned tree. Using a telescoping argument we cast KDE to streaming environments and extend the implementation of HS to incremental decision tree models. Armed with these extensions we investigate the performance of decision trees that may enjoy such options in datasets commonly used for regression in online settings. We conclude that KDE is beneficial in the early parts of the stream, while HS hardly, if ever, offers performance benefits.

In this work, we conduct a systematic empirical and statistical study of how the validation criterion used for model selection affects test performance in neural classifiers, with attention to early stopping. Using fully connected networks on standard benchmarks under $k$-fold evaluation, we compare: (i) early stopping with patience and (ii) post-hoc selection over all epochs (i.e. no early stopping). Models are trained with cross-entropy, C-Loss, or PolyLoss; the model parameter selection on the validation set is made using accuracy or one of the three loss functions, each considered independently. Three main findings emerge. (1) Early stopping based on validation accuracy performs worst, consistently selecting checkpoints with lower test accuracy than both loss-based early stopping and post-hoc selection. (2) Loss-based validation criteria yield comparable and more stable test accuracy. (3) Across datasets and folds, any single validation rule often underperforms the test-optimal checkpoint. Overall, the selected model typically achieves test-set performance statistically lower than the best performance across all epochs, regardless of the validation criterion. Our results suggest avoiding validation accuracy (in particular with early stopping) for parameter selection, favoring loss-based validation criteria."}

In SWE-Protégé, an SLM remains the sole decision-maker while learning to selectively seek guidance from a strong expert model, recognize stalled states, and follow through on expert feedback. Our approach combines supervised fine-tuning on expert-augmented trajectories with agentic reinforcement learning that explicitly discourages degenerative looping and unproductive expert collaboration. We lightly post-train Qwen2.5-Coder-7B-Instruct to achieve 42.4% Pass@1 on SWE-bench Verified, a +25.4% improvement over the prior SLM state of the art, while using expert assistance sparsely (~4 calls per task and 11% of total tokens)."}

A natural question arises from this phenomenon: Which component of the LVLM pipeline primarily contributes to object hallucinations? The vision encoder to perceive visual information, or the language decoder to generate text responses? In this work, we strive to answer this question through designing a systematic experiment to analyze the roles of the vision encoder and the language decoder in hallucination generation. Our observations reveal that object hallucinations are predominantly associated with the strong priors from the language decoder. Based on this finding, we propose a simple and training-free framework, No-Language-Hallucination Decoding, NoLan, which refines the output distribution by dynamically suppressing language priors, modulated based on the output distribution difference between multimodal and text-only inputs. Experimental results demonstrate that NoLan effectively reduces object hallucinations across various LVLMs on different tasks. For instance, NoLan achieves substantial improvements on POPE, enhancing the accuracy of LLaVA-1.5 7B and Qwen-VL 7B by up to 6.45 and 7.21, respectively.

We introduce \"Cultural Ghosting\", the systematic erasure of linguistic markers unique to non-native English varieties during text processing. Through analysis of 22,350 LLM outputs generated from 1,490 culturally marked texts (Indian, Singaporean,& Nigerian English) processed by five models under three prompt conditions, we quantify this phenomenon using two novel metrics: Identity Erasure Rate (IER) & Semantic Preservation Score (SPS). Across all prompts, we find an overall IER of 10.26%, with model-level variation from 3.5% to 20.5% (5.9x range). Crucially, we identify a Semantic Preservation Paradox: models maintain high semantic similarity (mean SPS = 0.748) while systematically erasing cultural markers. Pragmatic markers (politeness conventions) are 1.9x more vulnerable than lexical markers (71.5% vs. 37.1% erasure). Our experiments demonstrate that explicit cultural-preservation prompts reduce erasure by 29% without sacrificing semantic quality."}

While RLHF with expected reward constraints can be formulated as a primal-dual optimization problem, standard primal-dual methods only guarantee convergence with a distributional policy where the saddle-point problem is in convex-concave form. Moreover, standard primal-dual methods may exhibit instability or divergence in the last iterate under policy parameterization in practical applications. In this work, we propose a universal primal-dual framework for safe RLHF that unifies a broad class of existing alignment algorithms, including safe-RLHF, one-shot, and multi-shot based methods. Building on this framework, we introduce an optimistic primal-dual (OPD) algorithm that incorporates predictive updates for both primal and dual variables to stabilize saddle-point dynamics. We establish last-iterate convergence guarantees for the proposed method, covering both exact policy optimization in the distributional space and convergence to a neighborhood of the optimal solution whose gap is related to approximation error and bias under parameterized policies. Our analysis reveals that optimism plays a crucial role in mitigating oscillations inherent to constrained alignment objectives, thereby closing a key theoretical gap between constrained RL and practical RLHF."}

The final authenticated version is available online via the DOI below", "summary": "Cardiovascular disease (CVD) remains one of the leading global health challenges, accounting for more than 19 million deaths worldwide. To address this, several tools that aim to predict CVD risk and support clinical decision making have been developed. In particular, the Framingham Risk Score (FRS) is one of the most widely used and recommended worldwide. However, it does not explain why a patient was assigned to a particular risk category nor how it can be reduced. Due to this lack of transparency, we present a logical explainer for the FRS. Based on first-order logic and explainable artificial intelligence (XAI) fundaments, the explainer is capable of identifying a minimal set of patient attributes that are sufficient to explain a given risk classification. Our explainer also produces actionable scenarios that illustrate which modifiable variables would reduce a patient's risk category. We evaluated all possible input combinations of the FRS (over 22,000 samples) and tested them with our explainer, successfully identifying important risk factors and suggesting focused interventions for each case. The results may improve clinician trust and facilitate a wider implementation of CVD risk assessment by converting opaque scores into transparent and prescriptive insights, particularly in areas with restricted access to specialists."}

Conventional high-fidelity numerical models require a high resolution to obtain reliable results, resulting in huge computational expense. This restricts the applicability of these models for multi-query problems, such as uncertainty quantification and optimisation, which require running numerous scenarios. As a cheaper alternative to high-fidelity models, this work develops eight surrogate models for predicting the fluid flow in porous media. Four of these are reduced-order models (ROM) based on one neural network for compression and another for prediction. The other four are single neural networks with the property of grid-size invariance; a term which we use to refer to image-to-image models that are capable of inferring on computational domains that are larger than those used during training. In addition to the novel grid-size-invariant framework for surrogate models, we compare the predictive performance of UNet and UNet++ architectures, and demonstrate that UNet++ outperforms UNet for surrogate models. Furthermore, we show that the grid-size-invariant approach is a reliable way to reduce memory consumption during training, resulting in good correlation between predicted and ground-truth values and outperforming the ROMs analysed. The application analysed is particularly challenging because fluid-induced rock dissolution results in a non-static solid field and, consequently, it cannot be used to help in adjustments of the future prediction."}

This gap stems from two limitations: a shortage of high-quality, action-aligned reasoning data, and the direct adoption of generic post-training pipelines that overlook the unique challenges of GUI agents. We identify two fundamental issues in these pipelines: (i) standard SFT with CoT reasoning often hurts grounding, and (ii) step-wise RLVR-tyle training faces partial verifiability, where multiple actions can be correct but only a single demonstrated action is used for verification. This makes offline step-wise metrics weak predictors of online task success. In this work, we present GUI-Libra, a tailored training recipe that addresses these challenges. First, to mitigate the scarcity of action-aligned reasoning data, we introduce a data construction and filtering pipeline and release a curated 81K GUI reasoning dataset. Second, to reconcile reasoning with grounding, we propose action-aware SFT that mixes reasoning-then-action and direct-action data and reweights tokens to emphasize action and grounding. Third, to stabilize RL under partial verifiability, we identify the overlooked importance of KL regularization in RLVR and show that a KL trust region is critical for improving offline-to-online predictability; we further introduce success-adaptive scaling to downweight unreliable negative gradients. Across diverse web and mobile benchmarks, GUI-Libra consistently improves both step-wise accuracy and end-to-end task completion. Our results suggest that carefully designed post-training and data curation can unlock significantly stronger task-solving capabilities without costly online data collection. We release our dataset, code, and models to facilitate further research on data-efficient post-training for reasoning-capable GUI agents."}

These methods rely on adding imperceptible protective perturbations to images to thwart misuse such as style mimicry or deepfake manipulations. Although previous attacks on these protections required specialized, purpose-built methods, we demonstrate that this is no longer necessary. We show that off-the-shelf image-to-image GenAI models can be repurposed as generic ``denoisers\" using a simple text prompt, effectively removing a wide range of protective perturbations. Across 8 case studies spanning 6 diverse protection schemes, our general-purpose attack not only circumvents these defenses but also outperforms existing specialized attacks while preserving the image's utility for the adversary. Our findings reveal a critical and widespread vulnerability in the current landscape of image protection, indicating that many schemes provide a false sense of security. We stress the urgent need to develop robust defenses and establish that any future protection mechanism must be benchmarked against attacks from off-the-shelf GenAI models.

We demonstrate that adapting test-time compute scaling strategies, specifically Universal Self-Improvement (USI) and our proposed multi-round ranking method, T-RANK, allows for significantly higher quality outputs compared to traditional pipelines. Our framework ensures that benchmarks preserve their original task structure and linguistic nuances during localization. We apply this approach to translate popular benchmarks and datasets into eight Eastern and Southern European languages (Ukrainian, Bulgarian, Slovak, Romanian, Lithuanian, Estonian, Turkish, Greek). Evaluations using both reference-based metrics and LLM-as-a-judge show that our translations surpass existing resources, resulting in more accurate downstream model assessment. We release both the framework and the improved benchmarks to facilitate robust and reproducible multilingual AI development."}
