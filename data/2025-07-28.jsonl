This paper explores the\nintegration of two emerging paradigms enabled by large language models: Large\nReasoning Models (LRMs) and Large Action Models (LAMs). We argue that LRMs\naddress the challenges of semantic reasoning and ecosystem complexity while\nLAMs excel in dynamic action execution and system interoperability. However,\neach paradigm has complementary limitations - LRMs lack grounded action\ncapabilities, and LAMs often struggle with deep reasoning. We propose an\nintegrated LRM-LAM architectural framework as a promising direction for\nadvancing automated service composition. Such a system can reason about service\nrequirements and constraints while dynamically executing workflows, thus\nbridging the gap between intention and execution. This integration has the\npotential to transform service composition into a fully automated,\nuser-friendly process driven by high-level natural language intent."}

Drawing on these insights, we present MIRAGE (Meta-Inference with\nRules and Abstractions from Generalized Experience), a framework that achieves\nsystematic generalization on compositional tasks. MIRAGE has two interacting\nmodules mirroring the brain's deliberative HPC-PFC loop and intuitive\nneocortical pattern recognition. (1) The meta-trained Transformer Neural\nDecomposer, paralleling neocortical \"System 1\" computation, is trained on a\ntask-agnostic stream of randomly sampled compositional grammars and applies one\ndecomposition step per pass, with successive passes iteratively refining the\nsequence representation.

This research explores how RL,\nparticularly Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL), can be employed to develop\nautonomous, adaptive, and profitable market making strategies.\n  The study begins by formulating the MM task as a reinforcement learning\nproblem, designing agents capable of operating in both single-agent and\nmulti-agent settings within a simulated financial environment.

PBiLoss augments traditional\ntraining objectives by penalizing the model's inclination toward popular items,\nthereby encouraging the recommendation of less popular but potentially more\npersonalized content. We introduce two sampling strategies: Popular Positive\n(PopPos) and Popular Negative (PopNeg), which respectively modulate the\ncontribution of the positive and negative popular items during training. We\nfurther explore two methods to distinguish popular items: one based on a fixed\npopularity threshold and another without any threshold, making the approach\nflexible and adaptive. Our proposed method is model-agnostic and can be\nseamlessly integrated into state-of-the-art graph-based frameworks such as\nLightGCN and its variants. Comprehensive experiments across multiple real-world\ndatasets demonstrate that PBiLoss significantly improves fairness, as\ndemonstrated by reductions in the Popularity-Rank Correlation for Users (PRU)\nand Popularity-Rank Correlation for Items (PRI), while maintaining or even\nenhancing standard recommendation accuracy and ranking metrics.

However, Recurrent LLMs often underperform on long-context tasks\ndue to their limited fixed-size memory. Previous research has primarily focused\non enhancing the memory capacity of Recurrent LLMs through architectural\ninnovations, but these approaches have not yet enabled Recurrent LLMs to match\nthe performance of Self-Attention LLMs on long-context tasks. We argue that\nthis limitation arises because processing the entire context at once is not\nwell-suited for Recurrent LLMs. In this paper, we propose Smooth Reading, a\nchunk-wise inference method inspired by human reading strategies. Smooth\nReading processes context in chunks and iteratively summarizes the contextual\ninformation, thereby reducing memory demands and making the approach more\ncompatible with Recurrent LLMs. Our experimental results show that this method\nsubstantially narrows the performance gap between Recurrent and Self-Attention\nLLMs on long-context tasks, while preserving the efficiency advantages of\nRecurrent LLMs. Our Smooth Reading boosts SWA-3B-4k (a Recurrent LLM) from\n5.68% lower to 3.61% higher performance than Self-Attention LLMs on LongBench.\nBesides, our method maintains the high efficiency, training 3x faster and\ninferring 2x faster at 64k context compared to Self-Attention LLMs. To our\nknowledge, this is the first work to achieve comparable performance using\nRecurrent LLMs compared with Self-Attention LLMs on long-context tasks.

This paper introduces Step-3, a\n321B-parameter VLM with hardware-aware model-system co-design optimized for\nminimizing decoding costs. Step-3 innovates in two key dimensions: (1) A novel\nMulti-Matrix Factorization Attention (MFA) mechanism that significantly reduces\nboth KV cache size and computation while maintaining high attention\nexpressiveness, and (2) Attention-FFN Disaggregation (AFD), a distributed\ninference system that decouples attention and Feed-Forward Network (FFN) layers\ninto specialized subsystems. This co-design achieves unprecedented cost\nefficiency: Step-3 significantly reduces theoretical decoding costs compared\nwith models like DeepSeek-V3 and Qwen3 MoE 235B, with the gains widening at\nlonger context. Step-3 achieves low cost while activating 38B parameters per\ntoken (more than DeepSeek-V3 and Qwen3 MoE 235B), demonstrating that\nhardware-aligned attention arithmetic intensity, MoE sparsity, and AFD are\ncritical to cost-effectiveness. We perform a head-to-head comparison with\nDeepSeek-V3 in its favorable scenarios. Our implementation on Hopper GPUs\nachieves a decoding throughput of up to 4,039 tokens per second per GPU under\n50ms TPOT SLA (4K context, FP8, no MTP). It is higher than DeepSeek-V3's 2,324\nin the same setup and sets a new Pareto frontier for LLM decoding."}

We argue\nthat the interpretable nature of language can often provide a much richer\nlearning medium for LLMs, compared with policy gradients derived from sparse,\nscalar rewards. To test this, we introduce GEPA (Genetic-Pareto), a prompt\noptimizer that thoroughly incorporates natural language reflection to learn\nhigh-level rules from trial and error. Given any AI system containing one or\nmore LLM prompts, GEPA samples system-level trajectories (e.g., reasoning, tool\ncalls, and tool outputs) and reflects on them in natural language to diagnose\nproblems, propose and test prompt updates, and combine complementary lessons\nfrom the Pareto frontier of its own attempts. As a result of GEPA's design, it\ncan often turn even just a few rollouts into a large quality gain. Across four\ntasks, GEPA outperforms GRPO by 10% on average and by up to 20%, while using up\nto 35x fewer rollouts. GEPA also outperforms the leading prompt optimizer,\nMIPROv2, by over 10% across two LLMs, and demonstrates promising results as an\ninference-time search strategy for code optimization."}

Not Quite: Addressing Item Cold Start in Sequential Recommendations with Content-Based Initialization", "categories": ["cs.IR", "cs.AI", "cs.LG"], "comment": null, "summary": "Many sequential recommender systems suffer from the cold start problem, where\nitems with few or no interactions cannot be effectively used by the model due\nto the absence of a trained embedding. Content-based approaches, which leverage\nitem metadata, are commonly used in such scenarios. One possible way is to use\nembeddings derived from content features such as textual descriptions as\ninitialization for the model embeddings. However, directly using frozen content\nembeddings often results in suboptimal performance, as they may not fully adapt\nto the recommendation task. On the other hand, fine-tuning these embeddings can\ndegrade performance for cold-start items, as item representations may drift far\nfrom their original structure after training. We propose a novel approach to\naddress this limitation. Instead of entirely freezing the content embeddings or\nfine-tuning them extensively, we introduce a small trainable delta to frozen\nembeddings that enables the model to adapt item representations without letting\nthem go too far from their original semantic structure. This approach\ndemonstrates consistent improvements across multiple datasets and modalities,\nincluding e-commerce datasets with textual descriptions and a music dataset\nwith audio-based representation."}

Additionally, the unprecedented success\nof recent reasoning models and Deep Research-style models suggests that\ntechnology capable of greatly improving forecasting performance has been\ndeveloped. Therefore, based on these positive recent trends, we argue that the\ntime is ripe for research on large-scale training of superforecaster-level\nevent forecasting LLMs. We discuss two key research directions: training\nmethods and data acquisition. For training, we first introduce three\ndifficulties of LLM-based event forecasting training: noisiness-sparsity,\nknowledge cut-off, and simple reward structure problems. Then, we present\nrelated ideas to mitigate these problems: hypothetical event Bayesian networks,\nutilizing poorly-recalled and counterfactual events, and auxiliary reward\nsignals. For data, we propose aggressive use of market, public, and crawling\ndatasets to enable large-scale training and evaluation. Finally, we explain how\nthese technical advances could enable AI to provide predictive intelligence to\nsociety in broader areas. This position paper presents promising specific paths\nand considerations for getting closer to superforecaster-level AI technology,\naiming to call for researchers' interest in these directions."}
