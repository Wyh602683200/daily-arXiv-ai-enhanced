It allows\nLMMs to answer physical reasoning queries, such as the outcome of a potential\ncollision event from visual input. However, since parametric knowledge includes\nonly the physical laws seen during training, it is insufficient for reasoning\nwhen the inference scenario violates these physical laws. In contrast, humans\npossess the skill to adapt their physical reasoning to unseen physical\nenvironments from a few visual examples. This ability, which we refer to as\ninductive physical reasoning, is indispensable for LMMs if they are to replace\nhuman agents in safety-critical applications. Despite its importance, existing\nvisual benchmarks evaluate only the parametric knowledge in LMMs, and not\ninductive physical reasoning. To this end, we propose InPhyRe, the first visual\nquestion answering benchmark to measure inductive physical reasoning in LMMs.\nInPhyRe evaluates LMMs on their ability to predict the outcome of collision\nevents in algorithmically generated synthetic collision videos. By inspecting\n13 LMMs, InPhyRe informs us that (1) LMMs struggle to apply their limited\nparametric knowledge about universal physical laws to reasoning, (2) inductive\nphysical reasoning in LMMs is weak when demonstration samples violate universal\nphysical laws, and (3) inductive physical reasoning in LMMs suffers from\nlanguage bias and largely ignores the visual inputs, questioning the\ntrustworthiness of LMMs regarding visual inputs."}

To\nreduce the subjectivity inherent in that process and to accelerate data\nanalysis, we used convolutional neural networks (CNNs) to automatically segment\ncross-sectional images of microscopic TRISO layers. CNNs are a class of\nmachine-learning algorithms specifically designed for processing structured\ngrid data. They have gained popularity in recent years due to their remarkable\nperformance in various computer vision tasks, including image classification,\nobject detection, and image segmentation. In this research, we generated a\nlarge irradiated TRISO layer dataset with more than 2,000 microscopic images of\ncross-sectional TRISO particles and the corresponding annotated images. Based\non these annotated images, we used different CNNs to automatically segment\ndifferent TRISO layers. These CNNs include RU-Net (developed in this study), as\nwell as three existing architectures: U-Net, Residual Network (ResNet), and\nAttention U-Net. The preliminary results show that the model based on RU-Net\nperforms best in terms of Intersection over Union (IoU). Using CNN models, we\ncan expedite the analysis of TRISO particle cross sections, significantly\nreducing the manual labor involved and improving the objectivity of the\nsegmentation results."}

The scheduler introduces three innovative\nstrategies: (i) dynamic target timestep selection, which adapts to different\nconsistency distillation frameworks by selecting timesteps based on their\ncomputed importance; (ii) Optimized alternating sampling along the solution\ntrajectory by guiding forward denoising and backward noise addition based on\nthe proposed time step importance, enabling more effective exploration of the\nsolution space to enhance generation performance; and (iii) Utilization of\nsmoothing clipping and color balancing techniques to achieve stable and\nhigh-quality generation results at high guidance scales, thereby expanding the\napplicability of consistency distillation models in complex generation\nscenarios. We validated the effectiveness and flexibility of the adaptive\nsampling scheduler across various consistency distillation methods through\ncomprehensive experimental evaluations.

Specifically, Defense2Attack consists of three key components:\n(1) a visual optimizer that embeds universal adversarial perturbations with\naffirmative and encouraging semantics; (2) a textual optimizer that refines the\ninput using a defense-styled prompt; and (3) a red-team suffix generator that\nenhances the jailbreak through reinforcement fine-tuning. We empirically\nevaluate our method on four VLMs and four safety benchmarks. The results\ndemonstrate that Defense2Attack achieves superior jailbreak performance in a\nsingle attempt, outperforming state-of-the-art attack methods that often\nrequire multiple tries. Our work offers a new perspective on jailbreaking VLMs."}

In contrast, AI practitioners are accustomed to cloud-native\ntechnologies like Kubernetes and object storage, tools that are often difficult\nto integrate within traditional HPC environments.\n  This article advocates for a dual-stack approach within supercomputers:\nintegrating both HPC and cloud-native technologies. Our goal is to bridge the\ndivide between HPC and cloud computing by combining high performance and\nhardware acceleration with ease of use and service-oriented front-ends. This\nconvergence allows each paradigm to amplify the other. To this end, we will\nstudy the cloud challenges of HPC (Serverless HPC) and the HPC challenges of\ncloud technologies (High-performance Cloud)."}

RadGame addresses this gap\nby combining gamification with large-scale public datasets and automated,\nAI-driven feedback that provides clear, structured guidance to human learners.\nIn RadGame Localize, players draw bounding boxes around abnormalities, which\nare automatically compared to radiologist-drawn annotations from public\ndatasets, and visual explanations are generated by vision-language models for\nuser missed findings. In RadGame Report, players compose findings given a chest\nX-ray, patient age and indication, and receive structured AI feedback based on\nradiology report generation metrics, highlighting errors and omissions compared\nto a radiologist's written ground truth report from public datasets, producing\na final performance and style score. In a prospective evaluation, participants\nusing RadGame achieved a 68% improvement in localization accuracy compared to\n17% with traditional passive methods and a 31% improvement in report-writing\naccuracy compared to 4% with traditional methods after seeing the same cases.\nRadGame highlights the potential of AI-driven gamification to deliver scalable,\nfeedback-rich radiology training and reimagines the application of medical AI\nresources in education."}

This paper introduces a\ncontrastive learning framework for musical instrument retrieval, enabling\ndirect querying of instrument databases using a single model for both single-\nand multi-instrument sounds. We propose techniques to generate realistic\npositive/negative pairs of sounds for virtual musical instruments, such as\nsamplers and synthesizers, addressing limitations in common audio data\naugmentation methods.\n  The first experiment focuses on instrument retrieval from a dataset of 3,884\ninstruments, using single-instrument audio as input. Contrastive approaches are\ncompetitive with previous works based on classification pre-training. The\nsecond experiment considers multi-instrument retrieval with a mixture of\ninstruments as audio input. In this case, the proposed contrastive framework\noutperforms related works, achieving 81.7\\% top-1 and 95.7\\% top-5 accuracies\nfor three-instrument mixtures."}
