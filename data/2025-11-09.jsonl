To address these challenges, we\nintroduce DreamGym, the first unified framework designed to synthesize diverse\nexperiences with scalability in mind to enable effective online RL training for\nautonomous agents. Rather than relying on expensive real-environment rollouts,\nDreamGym distills environment dynamics into a reasoning-based experience model\nthat derives consistent state transitions and feedback signals through\nstep-by-step reasoning, enabling scalable agent rollout collection for RL. To\nimprove the stability and quality of transitions, DreamGym leverages an\nexperience replay buffer initialized with offline real-world data and\ncontinuously enriched with fresh interactions to actively support agent\ntraining. To improve knowledge acquisition, DreamGym adaptively generates new\ntasks that challenge the current agent policy, enabling more effective online\ncurriculum learning. Experiments across diverse environments and agent\nbackbones demonstrate that DreamGym substantially improves RL training, both in\nfully synthetic settings and in sim-to-real transfer scenarios. On non-RL-ready\ntasks like WebArena, DreamGym outperforms all baselines by over 30%. And in\nRL-ready but costly settings, it matches GRPO and PPO performance using only\nsynthetic interactions. When transferring a policy trained purely on synthetic\nexperiences to real-environment RL, DreamGym yields significant additional\nperformance gains while requiring far fewer real-world interactions, providing\na scalable warm-start strategy for general-purpose RL."}

Despite its significance, tokenization in the\ncontext of assembly code remains an underexplored area. This study aims to\naddress this gap by evaluating the intrinsic properties of Natural Language\nProcessing (NLP) tokenization models and parameter choices, such as vocabulary\nsize. We explore preprocessing customization options and pre-tokenization rules\ntailored to the unique characteristics of assembly code. Additionally, we\nassess their impact on downstream tasks like function signature prediction -- a\ncritical problem in binary code analysis.\n  To this end, we conduct a thorough study on various tokenization models,\nsystematically analyzing their efficiency in encoding assembly instructions and\ncapturing semantic nuances. Through intrinsic evaluations, we compare\ntokenizers based on tokenization efficiency, vocabulary compression, and\nrepresentational fidelity for assembly code. Using state-of-the-art pre-trained\nmodels such as the decoder-only Large Language Model (LLM) Llama 3.2, the\nencoder-only transformer BERT, and the encoder-decoder model BART, we evaluate\nthe effectiveness of these tokenizers across multiple performance metrics.\nPreliminary findings indicate that tokenizer choice significantly influences\ndownstream performance, with intrinsic metrics providing partial but incomplete\npredictability of extrinsic evaluation outcomes. These results reveal complex\ntrade-offs between intrinsic tokenizer properties and their utility in\npractical assembly code tasks.

Deep Knowledge Tracing (DKT), which\nleverages a Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) to predict student knowledge and\nperformance on exercises, has been proposed as a major advancement over\ntraditional KT methods. Several studies suggest that its performance gains stem\nfrom its ability to model bidirectional relationships between different\nknowledge components (KCs) within a course, enabling the inference of a\nstudent's understanding of one KC from their performance on others. In this\npaper, we challenge this prevailing explanation and demonstrate that DKT's\nstrength lies in its implicit ability to model prerequisite relationships as a\ncausal structure, rather than bidirectional relationships. By pruning exercise\nrelation graphs into Directed Acyclic Graphs (DAGs) and training DKT on causal\nsubsets of the Assistments dataset, we show that DKT's predictive capabilities\nalign strongly with these causal structures. Furthermore, we propose an\nalternative method for extracting exercise relation DAGs using DKT's learned\nrepresentations and provide empirical evidence supporting our claim.

At the same\ntime, there are well-documented imbalances in the training data and\noptimisation objectives of this technology, raising doubts as to whether LLMs\ncan represent the cultural diversity of their broad user base. In this study,\nwe look at LLMs and cultural values and examine how prompt language and\ncultural framing influence model responses and their alignment with human\nvalues in different countries. We probe 10 LLMs with 63 items from the Hofstede\nValues Survey Module and World Values Survey, translated into 11 languages, and\nformulated as prompts with and without different explicit cultural\nperspectives. Our study confirms that both prompt language and cultural\nperspective produce variation in LLM outputs, but with an important caveat:\nWhile targeted prompting can, to a certain extent, steer LLM responses in the\ndirection of the predominant values of the corresponding countries, it does not\novercome the models' systematic bias toward the values associated with a\nrestricted set of countries in our dataset: the Netherlands, Germany, the US,\nand Japan. All tested models, regardless of their origin, exhibit remarkably\nsimilar patterns: They produce fairly neutral responses on most topics, with\nselective progressive stances on issues such as social tolerance. Alignment\nwith cultural values of human respondents is improved more with an explicit\ncultural perspective than with a targeted prompt language. Unexpectedly,\ncombining both approaches is no more effective than cultural framing with an\nEnglish prompt. These findings reveal that LLMs occupy an uncomfortable middle\nground: They are responsive enough to changes in prompts to produce variation,\nbut too firmly anchored to specific cultural defaults to adequately represent\ncultural diversity."}

To address this, we introduce Iterative\nRegret-Minimization Fine-Tuning (Iterative RMFT), a post-training procedure\nthat repeatedly distills low-regret decision trajectories back into the base\nmodel. At each iteration, the model rolls out multiple decision trajectories,\nselects the k-lowest regret ones, and fine-tunes itself on them.

There\nare many ways in which researchers have attempted to evaluate the quality of\nthese XAI models, such as user studies or proposed objective metrics like\n\"fidelity\". However, these current XAI evaluation techniques are ad hoc at best\nand not generalizable. Thus, most studies done within this field conduct simple\nuser surveys to analyze the difference between no explanations and those\ngenerated by their proposed solution. We do not find this to provide adequate\nevidence that the explanations generated are of good quality since we believe\nany kind of explanation will be \"better\" in most metrics when compared to none\nat all. Thus, our study looks to highlight this pitfall: most explanations,\nregardless of quality or correctness, will increase user satisfaction. We also\npropose that emphasis should be placed on actionable explanations. We\ndemonstrate the validity of both of our claims using an agent assistant to\nteach chess concepts to users. The results of this chapter will act as a call\nto action in the field of XAI for more comprehensive evaluation techniques for\nfuture research in order to prove explanation quality beyond user satisfaction.\nAdditionally, we present an analysis of the scenarios in which placebic or\nactionable explanations would be most useful."}

The study explores how individuals experience and exercise levers\nof power, which are presented as social mechanisms that shape institutional\nresponses to technological change. The study reports on the responses of\npersonalized questionnaires designed to gather insight on a decision maker's\ninstitutional purview, based on an institutional governance framework developed\nfrom the work of Neo-institutionalists. Findings present the anonymized, real\nresponses and circumstances of respondents in the form of twelve fictional\npersonas of high-level decision makers from North America and Europe. These\npersonas illustrate how personal agency, organizational logics, and\ninstitutional infrastructures may intersect in the governance of AI. The\ndecision makers' responses to the questionnaires then inform a discussion of\nthe field-level personal power of decision makers, methods of fostering\ninstitutional stability in times of change, and methods of influencing\ninstitutional change in the field of AI. The final section of the discussion\npresents a table of the dynamics of the levers of power in the field of AI for\nchange makers and five testable hypotheses for institutional and social\nmovement researchers.

In this study, we investigated how various color\ntransformation techniques affect image registration between hematoxylin and\neosin (H&E) stained images and non-linear multimodal images. We used a dataset\nof 20 tissue sample pairs, with each pair undergoing several preprocessing\nsteps, including different color transformation (CycleGAN, Macenko, Reinhard,\nVahadane), inversion, contrast adjustment, intensity normalization, and\ndenoising. All images were registered using the VALIS registration method,\nwhich first applies rigid registration and then performs non-rigid registration\nin two steps on both low and high-resolution images. Registration performance\nwas evaluated using the relative Target Registration Error (rTRE). We reported\nthe median of median rTRE values (MMrTRE) and the average of median rTRE values\n(AMrTRE) for each method. In addition, we performed a custom point-based\nevaluation using ten manually selected key points. Registration was done\nseparately for two scenarios, using either the original or inverted multimodal\nimages. In both scenarios, CycleGAN color transformation achieved the lowest\nregistration errors, while the other methods showed higher errors. These\nfindings show that applying color transformation before registration improves\nalignment between images from different modalities and supports more reliable\nanalysis in digital pathology."}

The deep\nKoopman model utilizes neural networks to learn the linear dynamics from\nexperimental data, achieving a 45% improvement in open-loop prediction accuracy\nover conventional N4SID subspace identification. Both analyzed models were\nemployed in the EMPC formulation that includes interpretable economic costs,\nsuch as energy consumption, material losses due to inadequate pasteurization,\nand actuator wear. The feasibility of EMPC is ensured using slack variables.\nThe deep Koopman EMPC and N4SID EMPC are numerically validated on a nonlinear\nmodel of multivariable PU under external disturbance. The disturbances include\nfeed pump fail-to-close scenario and the introduction of a cold batch to be\npastuerized. These results demonstrate that the deep Koopmand EMPC achieves a\n32% reduction in total economic cost compared to the N4SID baseline. This\nimprovement is mainly due to the reductions in material losses and energy\nconsumption. Furthermore, the steady-state operation via Koopman-based EMPC\nrequires 10.2% less electrical energy.

However, existing graph models for\nrelational data primarily focus on spatial structure, treating temporal\ninformation merely as a filtering constraint to exclude future events rather\nthan a modeling signal, and are typically designed for single-task prediction.\nTo address these gaps, we introduce a temporal subgraph sampler that enhances\nglobal context by retrieving nodes beyond the immediate neighborhood to capture\ntemporally relevant relationships.
