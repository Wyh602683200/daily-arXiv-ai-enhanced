This paper presents\nan integrated Large Language Model (LLM)-based intelligent system for\nprescriptive maintenance that extends beyond traditional anomaly detection to\nprovide actionable maintenance recommendations. Building upon our prior LAMP\nframework for numerical data analysis, we develop a comprehensive solution that\ncombines bearing vibration frequency analysis with multi agentic generation for\nintelligent maintenance planning. Our approach serializes bearing vibration\ndata (BPFO, BPFI, BSF, FTF frequencies) into natural language for LLM\nprocessing, enabling few-shot anomaly detection with high accuracy. The system\nclassifies fault types (inner race, outer race, ball/roller, cage faults) and\nassesses severity levels. A multi-agentic component processes maintenance\nmanuals using vector embeddings and semantic search, while also conducting web\nsearches to retrieve comprehensive procedural knowledge and access up-to-date\nmaintenance practices for more accurate and in-depth recommendations. The\nGemini model then generates structured maintenance recommendations includes\nimmediate actions, inspection checklists, corrective measures, parts\nrequirements, and timeline specifications. Experimental validation in bearing\nvibration datasets demonstrates effective anomaly detection and contextually\nrelevant maintenance guidance. The system successfully bridges the gap between\ncondition monitoring and actionable maintenance planning, providing industrial\npractitioners with intelligent decision support.

The approach utilizes tabular\nQ-learning, based on action sequences, within a discretized quantum state\nspace, to effectively manage the exponential growth of the space dimension. The\nframework introduces a hybrid reward mechanism, combining a static,\ndomain-informed reward that guides the agent toward the target state with\ncustomizable dynamic penalties that discourage inefficient circuit structures\nsuch as gate congestion and redundant state revisits. By leveraging sparse\nmatrix representations and state-space discretization, the method enables\nscalable navigation of high-dimensional environments while minimizing\ncomputational overhead. Benchmarking on graph-state preparation tasks for up to\nseven qubits, we demonstrate that the algorithm consistently discovers\nminimal-depth circuits with optimized gate counts. Moreover, extending the\nframework to a universal gate set for arbitrary quantum states, it still\nproduces minimal depth circuits, highlighting the algorithm's robustness and\nadaptability. The results confirm that this RL-driven approach efficiently\nexplores the complex quantum state space and synthesizes near-optimal quantum\ncircuits, providing a resource-efficient foundation for quantum circuit\noptimization."}

However, data-driven approaches to this goal face challenges such\nas long-tailed factor distributions, analyzing pivotal stressors preceding\nsuicide incidents, and limited model explainability. Methods: We present a\nmulti-stage large language model framework to enhance SDoH factor extraction\nfrom unstructured text. Our approach was compared to other state-of-the-art\nlanguage models (i.e., pre-trained BioBERT and GPT-3.5-turbo) and reasoning\nmodels (i.e., DeepSeek-R1).

To investigate the\nmechanism behind this positional bias, our extensive experiments reveal a\nconsistent phenomenon we term the attention basin: when presented with a\nsequence of structured items (e.g., retrieved documents or few-shot examples),\nmodels systematically assign higher attention to the items at the beginning and\nend of the sequence, while neglecting those in the middle. Crucially, our\nanalysis further reveals that allocating higher attention to critical\ninformation is key to enhancing model performance. Based on these insights, we\nintroduce Attention-Driven Reranking (AttnRank), a two-stage framework that (i)\nestimates a model's intrinsic positional attention preferences using a small\ncalibration set, and (ii) reorders retrieved documents or few-shot examples to\nalign the most salient content with these high-attention positions. AttnRank is\na model-agnostic, training-free, and plug-and-play method with minimal\ncomputational overhead. Experiments on multi-hop QA and few-shot in-context\nlearning tasks demonstrate that AttnRank achieves substantial improvements\nacross 10 large language models of varying architectures and scales, without\nmodifying model parameters or training procedures."}

However, the high\ndimensionality of EEG features, coupled with limited sample sizes, frequently\nleads to classifier overfitting and high computational complexity. Feature\nselection constitutes a critical strategy for mitigating these challenges. Most\nexisting EEG feature selection methods assume complete multi-dimensional\nemotion labels. In practice, open acquisition environment, and the inherent\nsubjectivity of emotion perception often result in incomplete label data, which\ncan compromise model generalization. Additionally, existing feature selection\nmethods for handling incomplete multi-dimensional labels primarily focus on\ncorrelations among various dimensions during label recovery, neglecting the\ncorrelation between samples in the label space and their interaction with\nvarious dimensions. To address these issues, we propose a novel incomplete\nmulti-dimensional feature selection algorithm for EEG-based emotion\nrecognition. The proposed method integrates an adaptive dual self-expression\nlearning (ADSEL) with least squares regression. ADSEL establishes a\nbidirectional pathway between sample-level and dimension-level self-expression\nlearning processes within the label space. It could facilitate the\ncross-sharing of learned information between these processes, enabling the\nsimultaneous exploitation of effective information across both samples and\ndimensions for label reconstruction.

Despite impressive\nadvancements, vanilla RAG-based VQA methods that rely on unstructured documents\nand overlook the structural relationships among knowledge elements frequently\nintroduce irrelevant or misleading content, reducing answer accuracy and\nreliability. To overcome these challenges, a promising solution is to integrate\nmultimodal knowledge graphs (KGs) into RAG-based VQA frameworks to enhance the\ngeneration by introducing structured multimodal knowledge. Therefore, in this\npaper, we propose a novel multimodal knowledge-augmented generation framework\n(mKG-RAG) based on multimodal KGs for knowledge-intensive VQA tasks.\nSpecifically, our approach leverages MLLM-powered keyword extraction and\nvision-text matching to distill semantically consistent and modality-aligned\nentities/relationships from multimodal documents, constructing high-quality\nmultimodal KGs as structured knowledge representations. In addition, a\ndual-stage retrieval strategy equipped with a question-aware multimodal\nretriever is introduced to improve retrieval efficiency while refining\nprecision. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate that our approach\nsignificantly outperforms existing methods, setting a new state-of-the-art for\nknowledge-based VQA."}

Inspired by Cartesian principles from\n\\textit{Discours de la m\\'ethode}, this paper introduces Logic-Augmented\nGeneration (LAG), a novel paradigm that reframes knowledge augmentation through\nsystematic question decomposition and dependency-aware reasoning. Specifically,\nLAG first decomposes complex questions into atomic sub-questions ordered by\nlogical dependencies. It then resolves these sequentially, using prior answers\nto guide context retrieval for subsequent sub-questions, ensuring stepwise\ngrounding in logical chain. To prevent error propagation, LAG incorporates a\nlogical termination mechanism that halts inference upon encountering\nunanswerable sub-questions and reduces wasted computation on excessive\nreasoning. Finally, it synthesizes all sub-resolutions to generate verified\nresponses. Experiments on four benchmark datasets demonstrate that LAG\nsignificantly enhances reasoning robustness, reduces hallucination, and aligns\nLLM problem-solving with human cognition, offering a principled alternative to\nexisting RAG systems."}
