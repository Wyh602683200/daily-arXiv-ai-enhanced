To address these issues, this paper presents\nMSRFormer, a novel road network representation learning framework that\nintegrates multi-scale spatial interactions by addressing their flow\nheterogeneity and long-distance dependencies. It uses spatial flow convolution\nto extract small-scale features from large trajectory datasets, and identifies\nscale-dependent spatial interaction regions to capture the spatial structure of\nroad networks and flow heterogeneity.

To\novercome these limitations, we introduce REverse-Engineered Reasoning (REER), a\nnew paradigm that fundamentally shifts the approach. Instead of building a\nreasoning process ``forwards'' through trial-and-error or imitation, REER works\n``backwards'' from known-good solutions to computationally discover the latent,\nstep-by-step deep reasoning process that could have produced them. Using this\nscalable, gradient-free approach, we curate and open-source DeepWriting-20K, a\nlarge-scale dataset of 20,000 deep reasoning trajectories for open-ended tasks.\nOur model, DeepWriter-8B, trained on this data, not only surpasses strong\nopen-source baselines but also achieves performance competitive with, and at\ntimes superior to, leading proprietary models like GPT-4o and Claude 3.5."}

This paper introduces \\texttt{BFS-Prover-V2}, a system\ndesigned to address this dual scaling problem. We present two primary\ninnovations. The first is a novel multi-turn off-policy RL framework for\ncontinually improving the performance of LLM step-prover at training time. This\nframework, inspired by the principles of AlphaZero, utilizes a multi-stage\nexpert iteration pipeline featuring adaptive tactic-level data filtering and\nperiodic retraining to surmount the performance plateaus that typically curtail\nlong-term RL in LLM-based agents. The second innovation is a planner-enhanced\nmulti-agent search architecture that scales reasoning capabilities at inference\ntime. This architecture employs a general reasoning model as a high-level\nplanner to iteratively decompose complex theorems into a sequence of simpler\nsubgoals. This hierarchical approach substantially reduces the search space,\nenabling a team of parallel prover agents to collaborate efficiently by\nleveraging a shared proof cache. We demonstrate that this dual approach to\nscaling yields state-of-the-art results on established formal mathematics\nbenchmarks. \\texttt{BFS-Prover-V2} achieves 95.08\\% and 41.4\\% on the MiniF2F\nand ProofNet test sets respectively.

However, real-world medical datasets often suffer from\nmissing modalities due to cost, protocol, or patient-specific constraints.\nExisting methods primarily address this issue by learning from the available\nobservations in either the raw data space or feature space, but typically\nneglect the underlying bias introduced by the data acquisition process itself.\nIn this work, we identify two types of biases that hinder model generalization:\nmissingness bias, which results from non-random patterns in modality\navailability, and distribution bias, which arises from latent confounders that\ninfluence both observed features and outcomes. To address these challenges, we\nperform a structural causal analysis of the data-generating process and propose\na unified framework that is compatible with existing direct prediction-based\nmultimodal learning methods.

While Member States are\nearly movers in laying the ground for national AI regulatory sandboxes, the\narticle contends that there is a risk that differing approaches being taken by\nindividual national sandboxes could jeopardise a uniform interpretation of the\nAI Act and its application in practice. This could motivate innovators to play\nsandbox arbitrage. The article therefore argues that the European Commission\nand the AI Board need to act decisively in developing rules and guidance to\nensure a cohesive, coordinated approach in national AI regulatory sandboxes.\nWith sandbox participation being voluntary, the possibility that AI regulatory\nsandboxes may prove unattractive to innovators on their compliance journey is\nalso explored. Confidentiality concerns, the inability to relax legal rules\nduring the sandbox, and the inability of sandboxes to deliver a presumption of\nconformity with the AI Act are identified as pertinent concerns for innovators\ncontemplating applying to AI regulatory sandboxes as compared with other direct\ncompliance routes provided to them through application of harmonised standards\nand conformity assessment procedures."}

Anomaly detection methods, which train exclusively on\nbenign traffic to identify malicious activity, suffer from high false positive\nrates, limiting their usability. Recently, self-supervised learning techniques\nhave demonstrated improved performance with lower false positive rates by\nlearning discriminative latent representations of benign traffic. In\nparticular, contrastive self-supervised models achieve this by minimizing the\ndistance between similar (positive) views of benign traffic while maximizing it\nbetween dissimilar (negative) views. Existing approaches generate positive\nviews through data augmentation and treat other samples as negative. In\ncontrast, this work introduces Contrastive Learning using Augmented Negative\npairs (CLAN), a novel paradigm for network intrusion detection where augmented\nsamples are treated as negative views - representing potentially malicious\ndistributions - while other benign samples serve as positive views. This\napproach enhances both classification accuracy and inference efficiency after\npretraining on benign traffic. Experimental evaluation on the Lycos2017 dataset\ndemonstrates that the proposed method surpasses existing self-supervised and\nanomaly detection techniques in a binary classification task. Furthermore, when\nfine-tuned on a limited labelled dataset, the proposed approach achieves\nsuperior multi-class classification performance compared to existing\nself-supervised models."}

Our\nwork confronts this challenge by turning decades of automated theorem proving\nresearch into a scalable data engine. Rather than relying on error-prone LLMs\nor complex proof-assistant syntax like Lean and Isabelle, our framework\nleverages E-prover's saturation capabilities on the vast TPTP axiom library to\nderive a massive, guaranteed-valid corpus of theorems. Our pipeline is\nprincipled and simple: saturate axioms, filter for \"interesting\" theorems, and\ngenerate tasks. With no LLMs in the loop, we eliminate factual errors by\nconstruction. This purely symbolic data is then transformed into three\ndifficulty-controlled challenges: entailment verification, premise selection,\nand proof reconstruction. Our zero-shot experiments on frontier models reveal a\nclear weakness: performance collapses on tasks requiring deep, structural\nreasoning. Our framework provides both the diagnostic tool to measure this gap\nand a scalable source of symbolic training data to address it. We make the code\nand data publicly available.\n  https://github.com/sileod/reasoning_core\nhttps://hf.co/datasets/reasoning-core/rc1"}

This represents,\nto the best of our knowledge, the first application of an RL-based control\nstrategy to such a nonlinear and disturbance-prone bioprocess. Our method\nbegins with an offline training stage in which the RL agent learns from\ntrajectories generated by a nominal Proportional-Integral-Derivative (PID)\ncontroller, without direct interaction with the real system. This is followed\nby a daily online fine-tuning phase, enabling adaptation to evolving process\ndynamics and stronger rejection of fast, transient disturbances. This hybrid\noffline-online strategy allows deployment of an adaptive control policy capable\nof handling the inherent nonlinearities and external perturbations in open\nPBRs.
