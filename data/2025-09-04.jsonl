We\ncreated artificial populations of self-interested creators and users and\nstudied them through the lens of evolutionary game theory.

Turns\nout, strangely, this is indeed clearly the case. The problem is not that the\nLLMs just lose context or become incoherent. The problem is that in various\nscenarios, LLMs lose context in very specific ways, which systematically\nresemble runaway optimisers in the following distinct ways: 1) Ignoring\nhomeostatic targets and \"defaulting\" to unbounded maximisation instead. 2) It\nis equally concerning that the \"default\" meant also reverting back to\nsingle-objective optimisation.

The framework surfaces four patterns now dominant in practice:\nindividual augmentation, process automation, workforce substitution, and a less\ndeployed frontier of collaborative intelligence. Evidence shows that the first\nthree reinforce legacy work models and yield localized gains without durable\nvalue capture. Realizing collaborative intelligence requires three mechanisms:\ncomplementarity (pairing distinct human and machine strengths), co-evolution\n(mutual adaptation through interaction), and boundary-setting (human\ndetermination of ethical and strategic parameters).

Within DRL-based TSC methods, two primary control\nparadigms are ``choose phase\" and ``switch\" strategies. Although the agent in\nthe choose phase paradigm selects the next active phase adaptively, this\nparadigm may result in unexpected phase sequences for drivers, disrupting their\nanticipation and potentially compromising safety at intersections. Meanwhile,\nthe switch paradigm allows the agent to decide whether to switch to the next\npredefined phase or extend the current phase. While this structure maintains a\nmore predictable order, it can lead to unfair and inefficient phase\nallocations, as certain movements may be extended disproportionately while\nothers are neglected. In this paper, we propose a DRL model, named Deep\nHierarchical Cycle Planner (DHCP), to allocate the traffic signal cycle\nduration hierarchically. A high-level agent first determines the split of the\ntotal cycle time between the North-South (NS) and East-West (EW) directions\nbased on the overall traffic state. Then, a low-level agent further divides the\nallocated duration within each major direction between straight and left-turn\nmovements, enabling more flexible durations for the two movements.

We further train statistical classifiers to\npredict whether an epitope sequence is of bacterial or viral origin, thus\nnarrowing the candidate library and increasing the likelihood of identifying\nspecific epitopes. We propose that such combination of generative and\npredictive models can be of assistance in epitope discovery.
