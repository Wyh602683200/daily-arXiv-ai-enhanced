With the rapid expansion of metro networks, effective\nmulti-line scheduling and emergency management have become essential for\nlarge-scale seamless operations. However, current research focuses primarily on\nindividual metro lines,with insufficient attention on cross-line coordination\nand rapid replanning during disruptions. Here, a unified optimization framework\nis presented for multi-line metro crew planning and replanning with\nheterogeneous workforce. Specifically, a hierarchical time-space network model\nis proposed to represent the unified crew action space, and computationally\nefficient constraints and formulations are derived for the crew's heterogeneous\nqualifications and preferences. Solution algorithms based on column generation\nand shortest path adjustment are further developed, utilizing the proposed\nnetwork model. Experiments with real data from Shanghai and Beijing Metro\ndemonstrate that the proposed methods outperform benchmark heuristics in both\ncost reduction and task completion,and achieve notable efficiency gains by\nincorporating cross-line operations, particularly for urgent tasks during\ndisruptions.

Drawing inspiration from the human\nbrain, we propose a new paradigm that shifts the focus from external mimicry to\nthe development of foundational cognitive architectures. We define True\nIntelligence (TI) as a system characterized by six core components: embodied\nsensory fusion, core directives, dynamic schemata creation, a\nhighly-interconnected multi-expert architecture, an orchestration layer, and\nlastly, the unmeasurable quality of Interconnectedness, which we hypothesize\nresults in consciousness and a subjective experience.

We propose\nConjecturing-Proving Loop pipeline for automatically generating mathematical\nconjectures and proving them in Lean 4 format. A feature of our approach is\nthat we generate and prove further conjectures with context including\npreviously generated theorems and their proofs, which enables the generation of\nmore difficult proofs by in-context learning of proof strategies without\nchanging parameters of LLMs. We demonstrated that our framework rediscovered\ntheorems with verification, which were published in past mathematical papers\nand have not yet formalized. Moreover, at least one of these theorems could not\nbe proved by the LLM without in-context learning, even in natural language,\nwhich means that in-context learning was effective for neural theorem proving.\nThe source code is available at\nhttps://github.com/auto-res/ConjecturingProvingLoop."}

But humans have access to a broad and embodied context, which is\nkey in detecting and resolving linguistic ambiguities, even in isolated text\nspans. A foundational case of semantic ambiguity is found in the task of\ncoreference resolution: how is a pronoun related to an earlier person mention?\nThis capability is implicit in nearly every downstream task, and the presence\nof ambiguity at this level can alter performance significantly. We show that\nLLMs can achieve good performance with minimal prompting in both coreference\ndisambiguation and the detection of ambiguity in coreference, however, they\ncannot do both at the same time.

Specifically, we introduce a pure transformer\narchitecture with 4D rotary position embeddings to process visual inputs of\narbitrary resolutions and temporal durations. To ensure stable training, we\nintroduce an adversarial-free training objective that combines perceptual and\nGram matrix losses, achieving state-of-the-art reconstruction quality. By\nemploying a progressive training curriculum, AToken gradually expands from\nsingle images, videos, and 3D, and supports both continuous and discrete latent\ntokens. AToken achieves 0.21 rFID with 82.2% ImageNet accuracy for images, 3.01\nrFVD with 32.6% MSRVTT retrieval for videos, and 28.19 PSNR with 90.9%\nclassification accuracy for 3D.

The architecture of GTs typically integrates Graph Neural Networks\n(GNNs) with global attention mechanisms either in parallel or as a precursor to\nattention mechanisms, yielding a local-and-global or local-to-global attention\nscheme. However, as the global attention mechanism primarily captures\nlong-range dependencies between nodes, these integration schemes may suffer\nfrom information loss, where the local neighborhood information learned by GNN\ncould be diluted by the attention mechanism. Therefore, we propose G2LFormer,\nfeaturing a novel global-to-local attention scheme where the shallow network\nlayers use attention mechanisms to capture global information, while the deeper\nlayers employ GNN modules to learn local structural information, thereby\npreventing nodes from ignoring their immediate neighbors. An effective\ncross-layer information fusion strategy is introduced to allow local layers to\nretain beneficial information from global layers and alleviate information\nloss, with acceptable trade-offs in scalability. To validate the feasibility of\nthe global-to-local attention scheme, we compare G2LFormer with\nstate-of-the-art linear GTs and GNNs on node-level and graph-level tasks.

ADC incorporates two\nparallel compression strategies. The first one merges samples' activations that\nare similar, based on the average attention score calculated in the last client\nlayer; this strategy is class-agnostic, meaning that it can also merge samples\nhaving different classes, without losing generalization ability nor decreasing\nfinal results. The second strategy follows the first and discards the least\nmeaningful tokens, further reducing the communication cost. Combining these\nstrategies not only allows for sending less during the forward pass, but also\nthe gradients are naturally compressed, allowing the whole model to be trained\nwithout additional tuning or approximations of the gradients.
