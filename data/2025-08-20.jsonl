However, most existing\nmulti-agent systems are built upon manual prompt/workflow engineering with\nsophisticated agent frameworks, making them computationally inefficient, less\ncapable, and can not benefit from data-centric learning. In this work, we\nintroduce Chain-of-Agents (CoA), a novel paradigm of LLM reasoning that enables\nnative end-to-end complex problem-solving in the same way as a multi-agent\nsystem (i.e., multi-turn problem solving with multiple tools and multiple\nagents) within one model. In chain-of-agents problem-solving, the model\ndynamically activates different tool agents and role-playing agents to simulate\nmulti-agent collaboration in an end-to-end fashion. To elicit end-to-end\nchain-of-agents problem-solving abilities in LLMs, we introduce a multi-agent\ndistillation framework to distill state-of-the-art multi-agent systems into\nchain-of-agents trajectories for agentic supervised fine-tuning. We then use\nagentic reinforcement learning on verifiable agentic tasks to further improve\nthe models' capabilities on chain-of-agents problem solving.

Cognitive Workspace addresses these\nlimitations through three core innovations: (1) active memory management with\ndeliberate information curation, (2) hierarchical cognitive buffers enabling\npersistent working states, and (3) task-driven context optimization that\ndynamically adapts to cognitive demands. Empirical validation demonstrates\nCognitive Workspace achieves an average 58.6% memory reuse rate (ranging from\n54-60% across different tasks) compared to 0% for traditional RAG, with 17-18%\nnet efficiency gain despite 3.3x higher operation counts.

To\naddress this gap, we develop LOOP -- a novel neuro-symbolic planning framework\nthat treats planning as an iterative conversation between neural and symbolic\ncomponents rather than simple translation. LOOP integrates 13 coordinated\nneural features including graph neural networks for spatial relationships,\nmulti-agent validation for consensus-based correctness, hierarchical\ndecomposition for complex task management, and causal memory that learns from\nboth successes and failures.

While Automated Machine Learning (AutoML) frameworks streamline\nmodel development, they often lack adaptability and responsiveness to\ndomain-specific needs and evolving objectives. Concurrently, Large Language\nModels (LLMs) have enabled agentic systems capable of reasoning, memory\nmanagement, and dynamic code generation, offering a path toward more flexible\nworkflow automation. In this paper, we introduce \\textsf{TS-Agent}, a modular\nagentic framework designed to automate and enhance time-series modeling\nworkflows for financial applications. The agent formalizes the pipeline as a\nstructured, iterative decision process across three stages: model selection,\ncode refinement, and fine-tuning, guided by contextual reasoning and\nexperimental feedback. Central to our architecture is a planner agent equipped\nwith structured knowledge banks, curated libraries of models and refinement\nstrategies, which guide exploration, while improving interpretability and\nreducing error propagation. \\textsf{TS-Agent} supports adaptive learning,\nrobust debugging, and transparent auditing, key requirements for high-stakes\nenvironments such as financial services.

Nowadays, financial decisions are shaped by external\npressures like obligatory consumption, algorithmic persuasion, and unstable\nwork schedules that erode financial autonomy. Obligatory consumption (like\nhidden fees) is intensified by digital ecosystems. Algorithmic tactics like\npersonalized recommendations lead to impulsive purchases. Unstable work\nschedules also undermine financial planning. Thus, it is important to study how\nthese factors impact consumption agency. To do so, we examine formal models\ngrounded in discounted consumption with constraints that bound agency. We\nconstruct analytical scenarios in which consumers face obligatory payments,\nalgorithm-influenced impulsive expenses, or unpredictable income due to\ntemporal instability. Using this framework, we demonstrate that even rational,\nutility-maximizing agents can experience early financial ruin when agency is\nlimited across structural, behavioral, or temporal dimensions and how\ndiminished autonomy impacts long-term financial well-being.

To address these challenges, we propose\nFedOL, to construct a larger and more comprehensive server model in one-shot\nsettings (i.e., in a single communication round). Instead of model parameter\nsharing, FedOL employs knowledge distillation, where clients only exchange\nmodel prediction outputs on an unlabeled public dataset. This reduces\ncommunication overhead by transmitting compact predictions instead of full\nmodel weights and enables model customization by allowing heterogeneous model\narchitectures. A key challenge in this setting is that client predictions may\nbe biased due to skewed local data distributions, and the lack of ground-truth\nlabels in the public dataset further complicates reliable learning. To mitigate\nthese issues, FedOL introduces a specialized objective function that\niteratively refines pseudo-labels and the server model, improving learning\nreliability. To complement this, FedOL incorporates a tailored pseudo-label\ngeneration and knowledge distillation strategy that effectively integrates\ndiverse knowledge. Simulation results show that FedOL significantly outperforms\nexisting baselines, offering a cost-effective solution for mobile networks\nwhere clients possess valuable private data but limited computational\nresources."}

This\npaper aims to show this by conducting a thorough examination of the\nmethodologies of existing metrics, their documented strengths and limitations,\nvalidation methods, and correlations with human judgment.

Functional MRI (fMRI) offers a\nnon-invasive window into large-scale neural dynamics by measuring\nblood-oxygen-level-dependent (BOLD) signals across the brain. These signals can\nbe modeled as interactions among Regions of Interest (ROIs), which are grouped\ninto functional communities based on their underlying roles in brain function.\nEmerging evidence suggests that connectivity patterns within and between these\ncommunities are particularly sensitive to ASD-related alterations. Effectively\ncapturing these patterns and identifying interactions that deviate from typical\ndevelopment is essential for improving ASD diagnosis and enabling biomarker\ndiscovery. In this work, we introduce ASDFormer, a Transformer-based\narchitecture that incorporates a Mixture of Pooling-Classifier Experts (MoE) to\ncapture neural signatures associated with ASD. By integrating multiple\nspecialized expert branches with attention mechanisms, ASDFormer adaptively\nemphasizes different brain regions and connectivity patterns relevant to\nautism. This enables both improved classification performance and more\ninterpretable identification of disorder-related biomarkers. Applied to the\nABIDE dataset, ASDFormer achieves state-of-the-art diagnostic accuracy and\nreveals robust insights into functional connectivity disruptions linked to ASD,\nhighlighting its potential as a tool for biomarker discovery."}

Since full retraining\nis costly, various machine unlearning methods have been proposed. In this\npaper, we firstly present an efficient knowledge graph (KG) unlearning\nalgorithm. We remark that KG unlearning is nontrivial due to the distinctive\nstructure of KG and the semantic relations between entities. Also, unlearning\nby estimating the influence of removed components incurs significant\ncomputational overhead when applied to large-scale knowledge graphs. To this\nend, we define an influence function for KG unlearning and propose to\napproximate the model's sensitivity without expensive computation of\nfirst-order and second-order derivatives for parameter updates. Specifically,\nwe use Taylor expansion to estimate the parameter changes caused by data\nremoval. Given that the first-order gradients and second-order derivatives\ndominate the computational load, we use the Fisher matrices and zeroth-order\noptimization to approximate the inverse-Hessian vector product without\nconstructing the computational graphs. Our experimental results demonstrate\nthat the proposed method outperforms other state-of-the-art graph unlearning\nbaselines significantly in terms of unlearning efficiency and unlearning\nquality.

This evolution involves fine-tuning LLMs on agent-specific\ntasks to enhance their proficiency. However, safety concerns are frequently\noverlooked during this fine-tuning process. In this work, we show that aligned\nLLMs can become unintentionally misaligned, leading to a higher likelihood of\nexecuting harmful tasks and a reduced tendency to refuse them when fine-tuned\nto execute agentic tasks. To address these safety challenges, we propose Prefix\nINjection Guard (PING), a simple yet effective method that prepends\nautomatically generated natural language prefixes to agent responses, guiding\nthem to refuse harmful requests while preserving performance on benign tasks.\nSpecifically, we introduce an iterative approach that alternates between (1)\ngenerating candidate prefixes and (2) selecting those that optimize both task\nperformance and refusal behavior. Experimental results demonstrate that PING\nsignificantly enhances the safety of fine-tuned LLM agents without sacrificing\ntheir effectiveness. PING consistently outperforms existing prompting\napproaches across diverse benchmarks in both web navigation and code generation\ntasks.
