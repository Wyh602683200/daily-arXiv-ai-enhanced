Conventional explainable AI approaches\noffer post-hoc justifications and often fail to establish genuine symbiotic\ncollaboration. In this paper, the Symbiotic Epistemology is presented as a\nphilosophical foundation for human-AI cognitive partnerships. Unlike frameworks\nthat treat AI as a mere tool or replacement, symbiotic epistemology positions\nAI as a reasoning partner, fostering calibrated trust by aligning human\nconfidence with AI reliability through explicit reasoning patterns and\nconfidence assessments. SynLang (Symbiotic Syntactic Language) is introduced as\na formal protocol for transparent human-AI collaboration. The framework is\nempirically validated through actual human-AI dialogues demonstrating AI's\nadaptation to structured reasoning protocols and successful metacognitive\nintervention. The protocol defines two complementary mechanisms: TRACE for\nhigh-level reasoning patterns and TRACE_FE for detailed factor explanations. It\nalso integrates confidence quantification, declarative control over AI\nbehavior, and context inheritance for multi-agent coordination. By structuring\ncommunication and embedding confidence-calibrated transparency, SynLang,\ntogether with symbiotic epistemology, enables AI systems that enhance human\nintelligence, preserve human agency, and uphold ethical accountability in\ncollaborative decision-making. Through dual-level transparency, beginning with\nhigh-level reasoning patterns and progressing to granular explanations, the\nprotocol facilitates rapid comprehension and supports thorough verification of\nAI decision-making."}

In the middle phase, we propose the task-specific modality-shared\ndynamic generating adapter, which constructs prompts that are tailored to\nindividual tasks while remaining general across modalities, which balances the\nmodels ability to retain knowledge against forgetting with its potential for\nversatile multi-task transferability. In the deep phase, we introduce the\ntask-specific modality-independent prompts to further refine the understand\nability by targeting individual information for each task and modality. By\nincorporating these three phases, PHP retains task-specific prompts while\nadapting shared parameters for new tasks to effectively balance knowledge\nsharing and specificity. Our method achieves SOTA performance in different\norders of four tasks (AVE, AVVP, AVS and AVQA). Our code can be available at\nhttps://github.com/ENJOY-Yin-jiong/PHP."}

Such adaptive behavior inherently requires continuous\ninference under uncertainty. Bayesian statistics offers a principled\nprobabilistic framework to address this challenge by representing knowledge as\nprobability distributions and updating beliefs in response to new evidence. The\ncore computational processes underlying embodied intelligence - including\nperception, action selection, learning, and even higher-level cognition - can\nbe effectively understood and modeled as forms of Bayesian inference. Despite\nthe deep conceptual connection between Bayesian statistics and embodied\nintelligence, Bayesian principles have not been widely or explicitly applied in\ntoday's embodied intelligence systems. In this work, we examine both Bayesian\nand contemporary embodied intelligence approaches through two fundamental\nlenses: search and learning - the two central themes in modern AI, as\nhighlighted in Rich Sutton's influential essay \"The Bitter Lesson\". This\nanalysis sheds light on why Bayesian inference has not played a central role in\nthe development of modern embodied intelligence.

Despite the great potential, three key challenges persist when\napplying LLMs to HLS logic debugging: 1) High-quality circuit data for training\nLLMs is scarce, posing a significant challenge. 2) Debugging logic bugs in\nhardware is inherently more complex than identifying software bugs with\nexisting golden test cases. 3) The absence of reliable test cases requires\nmulti-tasking solutions, performing both bug identification and correction.\ncomplicates the multi-tasking required for effective HLS debugging. In this\nwork, we propose a customized solution named HLSDebugger to address the\nchallenges. HLSDebugger first generates and releases a large labeled dataset\nwith 300K data samples, targeting HLS logic bugs. The HLSDebugger model adopts\nan encoder-decoder structure, performing bug location identification, bug type\nprediction, and bug correction with the same model. HLSDebugger significantly\noutperforms advanced LLMs like GPT-4 in bug identification and by more than 3x\nin bug correction. It makes a substantial advancement in the exploration of\nautomated debugging of HLS code."}

We developed CLCFinder, a cross-language\ncode identification tool, and constructed a CLB dataset involving three PL\ncombinations (Python-C/C++, Java-C/C++, and Python-Java) with nine interaction\ntypes. We fine-tuned 13 CodeLMs on this dataset and evaluated their\nperformance, analyzing the effects of dataset size, token sequence length, and\ncode comments. Results show that all CodeLMs performed poorly before\nfine-tuning, but exhibited varying degrees of performance improvement after\nfine-tuning, with UniXcoder-base achieving the best F1 score (0.7407). Notably,\nsmall fine-tuned CodeLMs tended to performe better than large ones. CodeLMs\nfine-tuned on single-language bug datasets performed poorly on CLB detection,\ndemonstrating the distinction between CLBs and single-language bugs.\nAdditionally, increasing the fine-tuning dataset size significantly improved\nperformance, while longer token sequences did not necessarily improve the model\nperformance. The impact of code comments varied across models. Some fine-tuned\nCodeLMs' performance was improved, while others showed degraded performance."}

We further strengthen Robinson's method by proving that fairly general\nvolume growth curves can be realized by stratified spaces. Finally, we carry\nout an analysis that suggests that as an RL agent acts, its latent\nrepresentation alternates between periods of low local dimension, while\nfollowing a fixed sub-strategy, and bursts of high local dimension, where the\nagent achieves a sub-goal (e.g., collecting an object) or where the\nenvironmental complexity increases (e.g., more obstacles appear).

As one\nbuilding block of this method, we propose a novel point-shifting mechanism to\nintroduce perturbations in point cloud data. Recently, AI has seen an\nexponential growth. Hence, it is important to understand the decision-making\nprocess of AI algorithms when they are applied in critical areas. Our work\nfocuses on explaining AI algorithms that classify point cloud data. An\nimportant aspect of the methods used for explaining AI algorithms is their\nability to produce explanations that are easy for humans to understand. This\nallows them to analyze the AI algorithms better and make appropriate decisions\nbased on that analysis. Therefore, in this work, we intend to generate\nmeaningful explanations that can be easily interpreted by humans. The point\ncloud data we consider represents 3D objects such as cars, guitars, and\nlaptops. We make use of point cloud segmentation models to generate\nexplanations for the working of classification models. The segments are used to\nintroduce perturbations into the input point cloud data and generate saliency\nmaps. The perturbations are introduced using the novel point-shifting mechanism\nproposed in this work which ensures that the shifted points no longer influence\nthe output of the classification algorithm. In contrast to previous methods,\nthe segments used by our method are meaningful, i.e. humans can easily\ninterpret the meaning of the segments. Thus, the benefit of our method over\nother methods is its ability to produce more meaningful saliency maps.

One pressing issue involves unsafe image-query pairs--jailbreak\ninputs specifically designed to bypass security constraints and elicit\nunintended responses from MLLMs. Compared to general multimodal data, such\nunsafe inputs are relatively sparse, which limits the diversity and richness of\ntraining samples available for developing robust defense models. Meanwhile,\nexisting guardrail-type methods rely on external modules to enforce security\nconstraints but fail to address intrinsic vulnerabilities within MLLMs.\nTraditional supervised fine-tuning (SFT), on the other hand, often over-refuses\nharmless inputs, compromising general performance. Given these challenges, we\npropose Secure Tug-of-War (SecTOW), an innovative iterative defense-attack\ntraining method to enhance the security of MLLMs. SecTOW consists of two\nmodules: a defender and an auxiliary attacker, both trained iteratively using\nreinforcement learning (GRPO). During the iterative process, the attacker\nidentifies security vulnerabilities in the defense model and expands jailbreak\ndata. The expanded data are then used to train the defender, enabling it to\naddress identified security vulnerabilities. We also design reward mechanisms\nused for GRPO to simplify the use of response labels, reducing dependence on\ncomplex generative labels and enabling the efficient use of synthetic data.\nAdditionally, a quality monitoring mechanism is used to mitigate the defender's\nover-refusal of harmless inputs and ensure the diversity of the jailbreak data\ngenerated by the attacker.
