This richer\nconception of systematicity has been obscured by the long shadow of the\n\"systematicity challenge\" to connectionism, according to which network\narchitectures are fundamentally at odds with what Fodor and colleagues termed\n\"the systematicity of thought.\" I offer a conceptual framework for thinking\nabout \"the systematicity of thought\" that distinguishes four senses of the\nphrase. I use these distinctions to defuse the perceived tension between\nsystematicity and connectionism and show that the conception of systematicity\nthat historically shaped our sense of what makes thought rational,\nauthoritative, and scientific is more demanding than the Fodorian notion. To\ndetermine whether we have reason to hold AI models to this ideal of\nsystematicity, I then argue, we must look to the rationales for systematization\nand explore to what extent they transfer to AI models. I identify five such\nrationales and apply them to AI.

To address this\nissue, we introduce GAze-Based Regularization in Imitation Learning (GABRIL), a\nnovel method that leverages the human gaze data gathered during the data\ncollection phase to guide the representation learning in IL. GABRIL utilizes a\nregularization loss which encourages the model to focus on causally relevant\nfeatures identified through expert gaze and consequently mitigates the effects\nof confounding variables. We validate our approach in Atari environments and\nthe Bench2Drive benchmark in CARLA by collecting human gaze datasets and\napplying our method in both domains.

Two critical\ncomponents, which are seeds and mutators, contain randomness and are closely\ntied to the conditions required for triggering bugs. Therefore, to address the\nchallenge of randomness, we propose to use large language models (LLMs) to\nremove the randomness in seeds and reduce the randomness in mutators.

RandLuzz analyzes function call\nchain or functionality to guide LLMs in generating reachable seeds. To\nconstruct bug-specific mutators, RandLuzz uses LLMs to perform bug analysis,\nobtaining information such as bug causes and mutation suggestions, which\nfurther help generate code that performs bug-specific mutations.

Recent research efforts have\nprogressively extended this paradigm to multimodal reasoning tasks. Due to the\ninherent complexity and diversity of multimodal tasks, especially in semantic\ncontent and problem formulations, existing models often exhibit unstable\nperformance across various domains and difficulty levels. To address these\nlimitations, we propose VL-Cogito, an advanced multimodal reasoning model\ntrained via a novel multi-stage Progressive Curriculum Reinforcement Learning\n(PCuRL) framework. PCuRL systematically guides the model through tasks of\ngradually increasing difficulty, substantially improving its reasoning\nabilities across diverse multimodal contexts. The framework introduces two key\ninnovations: (1) an online difficulty soft weighting mechanism, dynamically\nadjusting training difficulty across successive RL training stages; and (2) a\ndynamic length reward mechanism, which encourages the model to adaptively\nregulate its reasoning path length according to task complexity, thus balancing\nreasoning efficiency with correctness.

In particular, current approaches may\nencounter limitations in controller scalability, flexible resource placement,\nand efficient orchestration when handling complex RLHF pipelines, especially in\nscenarios involving dynamic sampling or generative reward modeling. In this\npaper, we present \\textbf{G-Core}, a simple, scalable, and balanced RLHF\ntraining framework designed to address these challenges. G-Core introduces a\nparallel controller programming model, enabling flexible and efficient\norchestration of complex RLHF workflows without the bottlenecks of a single\ncentralized controller. Furthermore, we propose a dynamic placement schema that\nadaptively partitions resources and schedules workloads, significantly reducing\nhardware idle time and improving utilization, even under highly variable\ntraining conditions. G-Core has successfully trained models that support WeChat\nproduct features serving a large-scale user base, demonstrating its\neffectiveness and robustness in real-world scenarios.

To address this issue, we leverage FetalCLIP, a\nvision-language model pretrained on a curated dataset of over 210,000 fetal\nultrasound image-caption pairs, to perform automated fetal ultrasound image\nquality assessment (IQA) on blind-sweep ultrasound data. We introduce\nFetalCLIP$_{CLS}$, an IQA model adapted from FetalCLIP using Low-Rank\nAdaptation (LoRA), and evaluate it on the ACOUSLIC-AI dataset against six CNN\nand Transformer baselines.

However, these approaches face high\ntraining and inference costs, as well as challenges in extracting visual\ndetails, effectively bridging across modalities. In this work, we propose a\nnovel visual framework, MoCHA, to address these issues. Our framework\nintegrates four vision backbones (i.e., CLIP, SigLIP, DINOv2 and ConvNeXt) to\nextract complementary visual features and is equipped with a sparse Mixture of\nExperts Connectors (MoECs) module to dynamically select experts tailored to\ndifferent visual dimensions. To mitigate redundant or insufficient use of the\nvisual information encoded by the MoECs module, we further design a\nHierarchical Group Attention (HGA) with intra- and inter-group operations and\nan adaptive gating strategy for encoded visual features. We train MoCHA on two\nmainstream LLMs (e.g., Phi2-2.7B and Vicuna-7B) and evaluate their performance\nacross various benchmarks. Notably, MoCHA outperforms state-of-the-art\nopen-weight models on various tasks. For example, compared to CuMo\n(Mistral-7B), our MoCHA (Phi2-2.7B) presents outstanding abilities to mitigate\nhallucination by showing improvements of 3.25% in POPE and to follow visual\ninstructions by raising 153 points on MME.

Existing approaches to\nreconstructing images from these intermediate features often result in blurry,\nsemantically ambiguous images. To directly address semantic leakage, we propose\nCapRecover, a cross-modality inversion framework that recovers high-level\nsemantic content, such as labels or captions, directly from intermediate\nfeatures without image reconstruction.\n  We evaluate CapRecover on multiple datasets and victim models, demonstrating\nstrong performance in semantic recovery. Specifically, CapRecover achieves up\nto 92.71% Top-1 label accuracy on CIFAR-10 and generates fluent captions from\nResNet50 features on COCO2017 with ROUGE-L scores up to 0.52. Our analysis\nfurther reveals that deeper convolutional layers encode significantly more\nsemantic information compared to shallow layers.

However, dominant training paradigms face a critical\nlimitation: reinforcement learning (RL) methods that optimize solely for final\ntask success often reinforce flawed or inefficient reasoning paths, a problem\nwe term inefficient exploration. This leads to agents that are brittle and fail\nto generalize, as they learn to find solutions without learning how to reason\ncoherently. To address this, we introduce RLVMR, a novel framework that\nintegrates dense, process-level supervision into end-to-end RL by rewarding\nverifiable, meta-reasoning behaviors. RLVMR equips an agent to explicitly tag\nits cognitive steps, such as planning, exploration, and reflection, and\nprovides programmatic, rule-based rewards for actions that contribute to\neffective problem-solving. These process-centric rewards are combined with the\nfinal outcome signal and optimized using a critic-free policy gradient method.\nOn the challenging ALFWorld and ScienceWorld benchmarks, RLVMR achieves new\nstate-of-the-art results, with our 7B model reaching an 83.6% success rate on\nthe most difficult unseen task split.

Existing techniques for APR are\noften combined with LLMs (Large Language Models), which leverages the\ncode-related knowledge of LLMs to improve repair effectiveness. Current\nLLM-based APR methods typically utilize test cases only during the inference\nstage, adopting an iterative approach that performs repair first and validates\nit through test execution afterward. This conventional paradigm neglects two\nimportant aspects: the potential contribution of test cases in the training\nphase, and the possibility of leveraging testing prior to repair. To address\nthis, we propose Repair-R1, which introduces test cases into the model's\ntraining phase and shifts test generation to precede repair. The model is\nrequired to first generate discriminative test cases that can distinguish\ndefective behaviors, and then perform repair based on these tests. This enables\nthe model to better locate defects and understand the underlying causes of\ndefects, thereby improving repair effectiveness. We implement Repair-R1 with\nthree different backbone models, using RL (reinforcement learning) to\nco-optimize test generation and bug repair. Experimental results on four widely\nadopted benchmarks demonstrate the superiority of Repair-R1.

This\npaper investigates an unexplored new positional bias of ICL for the first time:\nwe observe that the predictions and accuracy can drift drastically when the\npositions of demos, the system prompt, and the user message in LLM input are\nvaried. We refer to this bias as DEMOS' POSITION IN PROMPT (DPP) bias.
