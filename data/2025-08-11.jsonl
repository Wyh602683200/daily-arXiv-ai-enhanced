Despite this\nsuccess, one question remains unanswered: is AL safe? In this work, we\nintroduce ALA, a practical and the first framework to utilize the acquisition\nfunction as the poisoning attack surface to reveal the weakness of active\nlearning. Specifically, ALA optimizes imperceptibly poisoned inputs to exhibit\nhigh uncertainty scores, increasing their probability of being selected by\nacquisition functions. To evaluate ALA, we conduct extensive experiments across\nthree datasets, three acquisition functions, and two types of clean-label\nbackdoor triggers. Results show that our attack can achieve high success rates\n(up to 94%) even under low poisoning budgets (0.5%-1.0%) while preserving model\nutility and remaining undetectable to human annotators. Our findings remind\nactive learning users: acquisition functions can be easily exploited, and\nactive learning should be deployed with caution in trusted data scenarios."}

Pre-training bias favours dominant\nlanguages, but even minimal exposure to under-represented languages during\nfine-tuning (as little as $9.62\\times10^{-11}$ of the original pre-training\ntoken volume) yields significant gains. These findings challenge the assumption\nthat cross-lingual mastery requires extensive multilingual training: limited\nlanguage coverage suffices for topic-level generalisation, and structural\nbiases can be corrected with lightweight interventions. By releasing\n4-bit-quantised, LoRA fine-tuned models, we provide an open-source,\nreproducible alternative to proprietary LLMs that delivers 35 times faster\ninference at just 0.00000989% of the dollar cost of the OpenAI GPT-4o model,\nenabling scalable, inclusive research."}

Using three advanced AI-text detectors (e.g.,\nBinoculars, Fast-Detect GPT, and GPTZero), we find substantial increase of\nGenAI use in recent years, especially in local and college news.

In this paper, we present ScamAgent, an autonomous multi-turn agent\nbuilt on top of LLMs, capable of generating highly realistic scam call scripts\nthat simulate real-world fraud scenarios. Unlike prior work focused on\nsingle-shot prompt misuse, ScamAgent maintains dialogue memory, adapts\ndynamically to simulated user responses, and employs deceptive persuasion\nstrategies across conversational turns. We show that current LLM safety\nguardrails, including refusal mechanisms and content filters, are ineffective\nagainst such agent-based threats. Even models with strong prompt-level\nsafeguards can be bypassed when prompts are decomposed, disguised, or delivered\nincrementally within an agent framework. We further demonstrate the\ntransformation of scam scripts into lifelike voice calls using modern\ntext-to-speech systems, completing a fully automated scam pipeline. Our\nfindings highlight an urgent need for multi-turn safety auditing, agent-level\ncontrol frameworks, and new methods to detect and disrupt conversational\ndeception powered by generative AI."}

The\nintuition mechanism is discovered via mind-tuning, the minimal principle that\nimposes Maximum Caliber in predictive models with a control temperature-like\nparameter $\\lambda$. Training on random walks in deterministic mazes reveals a\nrich phase diagram: imitation (low $\\lambda$), rule-breaking hallucination\n(high $\\lambda$), and a fragile in-between window exhibiting strong\nprotocol-dependence (hysteresis) and multistability, where models spontaneously\ndiscover novel goal-directed strategies.

Land Surface\nTemperature (LST) is a key variable in this context and is retrieved from\nremote sensing satellites. However, these systems face a trade-off between\nspatial and temporal resolution. While spatio-temporal fusion methods offer\npromising solutions, few have addressed the estimation of daily LST at 10 m\nresolution. In this study, we present WGAST, a Weakly-Supervised Generative\nNetwork for Daily 10 m LST Estimation via Spatio-Temporal Fusion of Terra\nMODIS, Landsat 8, and Sentinel-2. WGAST is the first end-to-end deep learning\nframework designed for this task. It adopts a conditional generative\nadversarial architecture, with a generator composed of four stages: feature\nextraction, fusion, LST reconstruction, and noise suppression. The first stage\nemploys a set of encoders to extract multi-level latent representations from\nthe inputs, which are then fused in the second stage using cosine similarity,\nnormalization, and temporal attention mechanisms. The third stage decodes the\nfused features into high-resolution LST, followed by a Gaussian filter to\nsuppress high-frequency noise. Training follows a weakly supervised strategy\nbased on physical averaging principles and reinforced by a PatchGAN\ndiscriminator. Experiments demonstrate that WGAST outperforms existing methods\nin both quantitative and qualitative evaluations. Compared to the\nbest-performing baseline, on average, WGAST reduces RMSE by 17.18% and improves\nSSIM by 11.00%. Furthermore, WGAST is robust to cloud-induced LST and\neffectively captures fine-scale thermal patterns, as validated against 33\nground-based sensors.
