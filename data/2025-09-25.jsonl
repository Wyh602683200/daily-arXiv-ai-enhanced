Existing evaluation approaches frequently suffer\nfrom high variance due to limited data and long-horizon tasks, or high bias due\nto unequal support or inaccurate environmental models. We posit that these\nchallenges arise, in part, from the standard reinforcement learning (RL)\nparadigm of policy learning without explicit consideration of evaluation. As an\nalternative, we propose evaluation-aware reinforcement learning (EvA-RL), in\nwhich a policy is trained to maximize expected return while simultaneously\nminimizing expected evaluation error under a given value prediction scheme --\nin other words, being \"easy\" to evaluate. We formalize a framework for EvA-RL\nand design an instantiation that enables accurate policy evaluation,\nconditioned on a small number of rollouts in an assessment environment that can\nbe different than the deployment environment. However, our theoretical analysis\nand empirical results show that there is often a tradeoff between evaluation\naccuracy and policy performance when using a fixed value-prediction scheme\nwithin EvA-RL. To mitigate this tradeoff, we extend our approach to co-learn an\nassessment-conditioned state-value predictor alongside the policy. Empirical\nresults across diverse discrete and continuous action domains demonstrate that\nEvA-RL can substantially reduce evaluation error while maintaining competitive\nreturns. This work lays the foundation for a broad new class of RL methods that\ntreat reliable evaluation as a first-class principle during training."}

In FedOC, overlapping clients could serve dual\nroles: (1) as Relay Overlapping Clients (ROCs), they forward edge models\nbetween neighboring ESs in real time to facilitate model sharing among\ndifferent ESs; and (2) as Normal Overlapping Clients (NOCs), they dynamically\nselect their initial model for local training based on the edge model delivery\ntime, which enables indirect data fusion among different regions of ESs. The\noverall FedOC workflow proceeds as follows: in every round, each client trains\nlocal model based on the earliest received edge model and transmits to the\nrespective ESs for model aggregation. Then each ES transmits the aggregated\nedge model to neighboring ESs through ROC relaying.

We propose TimeMosaic, a forecasting framework that\naims to address temporal heterogeneity. TimeMosaic employs adaptive patch\nembedding to dynamically adjust granularity according to local information\ndensity, balancing motif reuse with structural clarity while preserving\ntemporal continuity. In addition, it introduces segment-wise decoding that\ntreats each prediction horizon as a related subtask and adapts to\nhorizon-specific difficulty and information requirements, rather than applying\na single uniform decoder.

We assess our approach on five different datasets, with which\nwe simulate deployment conditions characterized by differing frequencies of\ndistributional shift. Our approach consistently outperforms conventional\nevaluation, with accuracy estimation errors typically ranging between 0.01 and\n0.1.

This limitation leads to inefficient task\nrouting, particularly in dynamic environments where agent capabilities\ncontinuously evolve. We introduce Knowledge Base-Aware (KBA) Orchestration, a\nnovel approach that augments static descriptions with dynamic,\nprivacy-preserving relevance signals derived from each agent's internal\nknowledge base (KB). In the proposed framework, when static descriptions are\ninsufficient for a clear routing decision, the orchestrator prompts the\nsubagents in parallel. Each agent then assesses the task's relevance against\nits private KB, returning a lightweight ACK signal without exposing the\nunderlying data. These collected signals populate a shared semantic cache,\nproviding dynamic indicators of agent suitability for future queries. By\ncombining this novel mechanism with static descriptions, our method achieves\nmore accurate and adaptive task routing preserving agent autonomy and data\nconfidentiality.

Second, we present a neural Transformer architecture with\nstrict E(3)-Symmetry and high non-linear expressiveness for Hamiltonian\nprediction. Third, we propose a novel training objective to ensure the accuracy\nperformance of Hamiltonians in both real space and reciprocal space, preventing\nerror amplification and the occurrence of \"ghost states\" caused by the large\ncondition number of the overlap matrix. On the dataset side, we curate a\nhigh-quality broad-coverage large benchmark, namely Materials-HAM-SOC,\ncomprising 17,000 material structures spanning 68 elements from six rows of the\nperiodic table and explicitly incorporating SOC effects. Experimental results\non Materials-HAM-SOC demonstrate that NextHAM achieves excellent accuracy and\nefficiency in predicting Hamiltonians and band structures."}

In this\nwork, we investigate factors impacting the model performance more directly: we\ncorrelate Tokenization Parity (TP) and Information Parity (IP), as measures of\nrepresentational biases in pre-trained multilingual models, with the downstream\nperformance. We compare state-of-the-art decoder-only LLMs with encoder-based\nmodels across three tasks: dialect classification, topic classification, and\nextractive question answering, controlling for varying scripts (Latin vs.\nnon-Latin) and resource availability (high vs. low). Our analysis reveals that\nTP is a better predictor of the performance on tasks reliant on syntactic and\nmorphological cues (e.g., extractive QA), while IP better predicts performance\nin semantic tasks (e.g., topic classification).

While RAG\nhas shown strong potential in reducing hallucinations and improving factual\nconsistency, it also introduces new privacy and security challenges that differ\nfrom those faced by traditional LLMs. Existing research has demonstrated that\nLLMs can leak sensitive information through training data memorization or\nadversarial prompts, and RAG systems inherit many of these vulnerabilities. At\nthe same time, reliance of RAG on an external knowledge base opens new attack\nsurfaces, including the potential for leaking information about the presence or\ncontent of retrieved documents, or for injecting malicious content to\nmanipulate model behavior. Despite these risks, there is currently no formal\nframework that defines the threat landscape for RAG systems. In this paper, we\naddress a critical gap in the literature by proposing, to the best of our\nknowledge, the first formal threat model for retrieval-RAG systems. We\nintroduce a structured taxonomy of adversary types based on their access to\nmodel components and data, and we formally define key threat vectors such as\ndocument-level membership inference and data poisoning, which pose serious\nprivacy and integrity risks in real-world deployments. By establishing formal\ndefinitions and attack models, our work lays the foundation for a more rigorous\nand principled understanding of privacy and security in RAG systems."}

This transformation emerged from simple\nprimitives: large, generative models trained on web-scale data. Curiously, the\nsame primitives apply to today's generative video models. Could video models be\non a trajectory towards general-purpose vision understanding, much like LLMs\ndeveloped general-purpose language understanding? We demonstrate that Veo 3 can\nsolve a broad variety of tasks it wasn't explicitly trained for: segmenting\nobjects, detecting edges, editing images, understanding physical properties,\nrecognizing object affordances, simulating tool use, and more. These abilities\nto perceive, model, and manipulate the visual world enable early forms of\nvisual reasoning like maze and symmetry solving. Veo's emergent zero-shot\ncapabilities indicate that video models are on a path to becoming unified,\ngeneralist vision foundation models."}

To uncover these\nreasoning process mechanisms in a fundamental and unified view, we set the\nbasic decoder-only transformers and explain them using the circuit-tracer\nframework. Through this lens, we visualize reasoning traces and identify two\ncore mechanisms in graph reasoning: token merging and structural memorization,\nwhich underlie both path reasoning and substructure extraction tasks. We\nfurther quantify these behaviors and analyze how they are influenced by graph\ndensity and model size.

This approach is often computationally expensive and\ncommunication-intensive. To address this limitation, we propose ET-MAPG\n(Event-Triggered Multi-Agent Policy Gradient reinforcement learning), a\nframework that jointly learns an agent's control policy and its\nevent-triggering policy. Unlike prior work that decouples these mechanisms,\nET-MAPG integrates them into a unified learning process, enabling agents to\nlearn not only what action to take but also when to execute it. For scenarios\nwith inter-agent communication, we introduce AET-MAPG, an attention-based\nvariant that leverages a self-attention mechanism to learn selective\ncommunication patterns. AET-MAPG empowers agents to determine not only when to\ntrigger an action but also with whom to communicate and what information to\nexchange, thereby optimizing coordination. Both methods can be integrated with\nany policy gradient MARL algorithm. Extensive experiments across diverse MARL\nbenchmarks demonstrate that our approaches achieve performance comparable to\nstate-of-the-art, time-triggered baselines while significantly reducing both\ncomputational load and communication overhead."}

It\nserves as the script for numerous languages, including Tigrinya and Amharic,\nand played a pivotal role in Ethiopia's cultural and religious development\nduring the Aksumite kingdom era.

These written materials are invaluable primary\nsources for studying Ethiopian and Eritrean philosophy, creativity, knowledge,\nand civilization. Ge'ez has a complex morphological structure with rich\ninflectional and derivational morphology, and no usable NLP has been developed\nand published until now due to the scarcity of annotated linguistic data,\ncorpora, labeled datasets, and lexicons. Therefore, we propose a rule-based\nGe'ez morphological synthesizer to generate surface words from root words\naccording to the morphological structures of the language. We used 1,102 sample\nverbs, representing all verb morphological structures, to test and evaluate the\nsystem.

Notably, it outperforms prior top models, both proprietary and open,\nwith fewer than 500M parameters, and provides performance comparable to models\ndouble its size, offering an exceptional performance-to-cost ratio. Remarkably,\nthis lead persists when quantizing model weights or truncating embedding\noutputs.
