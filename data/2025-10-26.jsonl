The\nalgorithm employs Matrix Product States (MPS) to compactly represent large\nsuperpositions of spin configurations and utilizes a discrete driving schedule\nto guide the MPS toward the ground state. At each step, a driver Hamiltonian --\nincorporating a transverse magnetic field -- is combined with the problem\nHamiltonian to enable spin flips and facilitate quantum tunneling. The MPS is\nupdated using the standard Density Matrix Renormalization Group (DMRG) method,\nwhich iteratively minimizes the system's energy via multiple sweeps across the\nspin chain. Despite its heuristic nature, the algorithm reliably identifies\nglobal minima, not merely near-optimal solutions, across diverse QUBO\ninstances. We first demonstrate its effectiveness on intermediate-level Sudoku\npuzzles from publicly available sources, involving over $200$ Ising spins with\nlong-range couplings dictated by constraint satisfaction. We then apply the\nalgorithm to MaxCut problems from the Biq Mac library, successfully solving\ninstances with up to $251$ nodes and $3,265$ edges. We discuss the advantages\nof this quantum-inspired approach, including its scalability, generalizability,\nand suitability for industrial-scale QUBO applications."}

In this paper, we introduce ToolEQA, an agent that integrates\nexternal tools with multi-step reasoning, where external tools can provide more\nuseful information for completing the task, helping the model derive better\nexploration directions in the next step of reasoning and thus obtaining\nadditional effective information. This enables ToolEQA to generate more\naccurate responses with a shorter exploration distance. To enhance the model's\nability for tool-usage and multi-step reasoning, we further design a novel EQA\ndata generation pipeline that automatically constructs large-scale EQA tasks\nwith reasoning trajectories and corresponding answers. Based on the pipeline,\nwe collect the EQA-RT dataset that contains about 18K tasks, divided into a\ntraining set EQA-RT-Train, and two test sets EQA-RT-Seen (scenes overlapping\nwith the training set) and EQA-RT-Unseen (novel scenes). Experiments on\nEQA-RT-Seen and EQA-RT-Unseen show that ToolEQA improves the success rate by\n9.2~20.2% over state-of-the-art baselines, while outperforming the zero-shot\nToolEQA by 10% in success rate. In addition, ToolEQA also achieves\nstate-of-the-art performance on the HM-EQA, OpenEQA, and EXPRESS-Bench\ndatasets, demonstrating its generality. Our homepage see\nhttps://tooleqa.github.io."}

To defend against these attacks, we propose CourtGuard, a\nlocally-runnable, multiagent prompt injection classifier. In it, prompts are\nevaluated in a court-like multiagent LLM system, where a \"defense attorney\"\nmodel argues the prompt is benign, a \"prosecution attorney\" model argues the\nprompt is a prompt injection, and a \"judge\" model gives the final\nclassification.

Deep learning-based\nbrain tumor classification methods often rely on heavy data augmentation which\ncan limit generalization and trust in clinical applications. In this paper, we\npropose a double-backbone network integrating VGG16 and Xception with a\nFrequency-Gated Attention (FGA) Block to capture complementary local and global\nfeatures. Unlike previous studies, our model achieves state-of-the-art\nperformance without augmentation which demonstrates robustness to variably\nsized and distributed datasets. For further transparency, Grad-CAM is\nintegrated to visualize the tumor regions based on which the model is giving\nprediction, bridging the gap between model prediction and clinical\ninterpretability. The proposed framework achieves 99.24\\% accuracy on the 7K-DS\ndataset for the 4-class setting, along with 98.68\\% and 99.85\\% in the 3-class\nand 2-class settings, respectively. On the independent 3K-DS dataset, the model\ngeneralizes with 95.77\\% accuracy, outperforming baseline and state-of-the-art\nmethods. To further support clinical usability, we developed a graphical user\ninterface (GUI) that provides real-time classification and Grad-CAM-based tumor\nlocalization. These findings suggest that augmentation-free, interpretable, and\ndeployable deep learning models such as DB-FGA-Net hold strong potential for\nreliable clinical translation in brain tumor diagnosis."}

There have been many works\nassessing the robustness of watermarking to removal attacks, yet, watermark\nforging, the scenario when a watermark is stolen from genuine content and\napplied to malicious content, remains underexplored. In this work, we\ninvestigate watermark forging in the context of widely used post-hoc image\nwatermarking. Our contributions are as follows. First, we introduce a\npreference model to assess whether an image is watermarked. The model is\ntrained using a ranking loss on purely procedurally generated images without\nany need for real watermarks. Second, we demonstrate the model's capability to\nremove and forge watermarks by optimizing the input image through\nbackpropagation. This technique requires only a single watermarked image and\nworks without knowledge of the watermarking model, making our attack much\nsimpler and more practical than attacks introduced in related work. Third, we\nevaluate our proposed method on a variety of post-hoc image watermarking\nmodels, demonstrating that our approach can effectively forge watermarks,\nquestioning the security of current watermarking approaches.

In\nthis work, we propose a novel approach to reasoning generalization by learning\nenergy landscapes over the solution spaces of smaller, more tractable\nsubproblems.

The second\nlifts this assumption by utilizing a Graph Neural Network (GNN) to capture\ninter-variable relationships. Both models demonstrate strong forecasting\nperformance up to a horizon of 20 time points and maintain stable anomaly\nprediction up to 50 time points. The GNN consistently outperforms the N-BEATS\nmodel while requiring significantly fewer trainable parameters and lower\ncomputational cost.

We propose VAMOS, a hierarchical VLA that\ndecouples semantic planning from embodiment grounding: a generalist planner\nlearns from diverse, open-world data, while a specialist affordance model\nlearns the robot's physical constraints and capabilities in safe, low-cost\nsimulation. We enabled this separation by carefully designing an interface that\nlets a high-level planner propose candidate paths directly in image space that\nthe affordance model then evaluates and re-ranks. Our real-world experiments\nshow that VAMOS achieves higher success rates in both indoor and complex\noutdoor navigation than state-of-the-art model-based and end-to-end learning\nmethods. We also show that our hierarchical design enables cross-embodied\nnavigation across legged and wheeled robots and is easily steerable using\nnatural language. Real-world ablations confirm that the specialist model is key\nto embodiment grounding, enabling a single high-level planner to be deployed\nacross physically distinct wheeled and legged robots. Finally, this model\nsignificantly enhances single-robot reliability, achieving 3X higher success\nrates by rejecting physically infeasible plans. Website:\nhttps://vamos-vla.github.io/"}

While\nthese models have shown remarkable success across single-modality domains such\nas images and audio, extending their capabilities to Modality Translation (MT),\ntranslating information across different sensory modalities, remains an open\nchallenge. Existing approaches often rely on restrictive assumptions, including\nshared dimensionality, Gaussian source priors, and modality-specific\narchitectures, which limit their generality and theoretical grounding. In this\nwork, we propose the Latent Denoising Diffusion Bridge Model (LDDBM), a\ngeneral-purpose framework for modality translation based on a latent-variable\nextension of Denoising Diffusion Bridge Models. By operating in a shared latent\nspace, our method learns a bridge between arbitrary modalities without\nrequiring aligned dimensions. We introduce a contrastive alignment loss to\nenforce semantic consistency between paired samples and design a\ndomain-agnostic encoder-decoder architecture tailored for noise prediction in\nlatent space. Additionally, we propose a predictive loss to guide training\ntoward accurate cross-domain translation and explore several training\nstrategies to improve stability. Our approach supports arbitrary modality pairs\nand performs strongly on diverse MT tasks, including multi-view to 3D shape\ngeneration, image super-resolution, and multi-view scene synthesis.\nComprehensive experiments and ablations validate the effectiveness of our\nframework, establishing a new strong baseline in general modality translation.\nFor more information, see our project page:\nhttps://sites.google.com/view/lddbm/home."}
