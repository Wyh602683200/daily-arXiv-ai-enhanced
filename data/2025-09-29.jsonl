This\npresents a challenge when the information used to elicit behaviors inevitably\nleaks into the data that monitors ingest, inflating their effectiveness. We\npresent a systematic framework for evaluating a monitor's performance in terms\nof its ability to detect genuine model behavior rather than superficial\nelicitation artifacts. Furthermore, we propose three novel strategies to\nevaluate the monitor: content filtering (removing deception-related text from\ninputs), score filtering (aggregating only over task-relevant tokens), and\nprompt distilled fine-tuned model organisms (models trained to exhibit\ndeceptive behavior without explicit prompting). Using deception detection as a\nrepresentative case study, we identify two forms of leakage that inflate\nmonitor performance: elicitation leakage from prompts that explicitly request\nharmful behavior, and reasoning leakage from models that verbalize their\ndeceptive actions. Through experiments on multiple deception benchmarks, we\napply our proposed mitigation strategies and measure performance retention. Our\nevaluation of the monitors reveal three crucial findings: (1) Content filtering\nis a good mitigation strategy that allows for a smooth removal of elicitation\nsignal and can decrease probe AUROC by 30\\% (2) Score filtering was found to\nreduce AUROC by 15\\% but is not as straightforward to attribute to (3) A\nfinetuned model organism improves monitor evaluations but reduces their\nperformance by upto 40\\%, even when re-trained."}

Based on this concept, we build REMA, a framework that explains the\norigins of failures by quantitatively comparing the spatial relationships of\ninternal model representations corresponding to both erroneous and correct\nreasoning samples. Specifically, REMA first quantifies the geometric deviation\nof each erroneous representation by calculating its k-nearest neighbors\ndistance to the approximated manifold formed by correct representations,\nthereby providing a unified failure signal.

A third senior\nresearcher adjudicated whenever the two primary raters disagreed, yielding\n10,100 individual judgements. The results reveal a strong gender imbalance,\nwith ImageFX outputs being 85\\% male, Grok 86.6\\% male, and DALL-E V3 96\\%\nmale, indicating that DALL-E V3 exhibited the strongest overall gender\nstereotyping. This imbalance was most evident in leadership and technical\nroles. Moreover, cultural inaccuracies in clothing, settings, and depicted\nactivities were frequently observed across all three models.\nCounter-stereotypical images often arise from cultural misinterpretations\nrather than genuinely progressive portrayals. We conclude that current models\nmirror societal biases embedded in their training data, generated by humans,\noffering only a limited reflection of the Saudi labour market's gender dynamics\nand cultural nuances.

In (I), $G_F$ is random, and top layer overfits to random hidden\nrepresentation. In (II), the gradient of each node (column of $G_F$) only\ndepends on its own activation, and thus each hidden node learns their\nrepresentation independently from $G_F$, which now carries information about\ntarget labels, thanks to weight decay.

Existing\nactivation compression methods reduce this cost but relying on repeated\nlow-rank decompositions, introducing computational overhead.

This bottleneck is substantial; for\ninstance, a Llama-3.1-8B model processing a 32K-token prompt at a batch size of\n4 requires approximately 16GB for its KV cache, a size exceeding the model's\nweights. While KV-cache compression via low-rank projection is a promising\ndirection, existing methods rely on a static, offline-learned subspace that\nperforms poorly under data distribution shifts. To overcome these limitations,\nwe introduce OjaKV, a novel framework that integrates a strategic hybrid\nstorage policy with online subspace adaptation. First, OjaKV recognizes that\nnot all tokens are equally important for compression; it preserves the crucial\nfirst and most recent tokens in full-rank, maintaining high-fidelity anchors\nfor attention. Second, for the vast majority of intermediate tokens, it applies\nlow-rank compression by incrementally adapting the projection basis using Oja's\nalgorithm for online principal component analysis. This adaptation involves a\ncomprehensive update during prompt prefilling and lightweight periodic updates\nduring decoding, ensuring the subspace remains aligned with the evolving\ncontext. Crucially, our framework is fully compatible with modern attention\nmodules like FlashAttention.

With the advent of \"thinking with images\" models, reasoning now\nextends beyond text to the visual domain. This capability motivates our\ntwo-stage \"coarse-to-fine\" reasoning pipeline: first, a downsampled image is\nanalyzed to identify task-relevant regions; then, only these regions are\ncropped at full resolution and processed in a subsequent reasoning stage. This\napproach reduces computational cost while preserving fine-grained visual\ndetails where necessary. A major challenge lies in inferring which regions are\ntruly relevant to a given query.

Hence, it is essential to investigate the capability of\ntransformers in the task of inferring transitive relations (e.g., knowing A\ncauses B and B causes C, then A causes C). The task of inferring transitive\nrelations is equivalent to the task of connectivity in directed graphs (e.g.,\nknowing there is a path from A to B, and there is a path from B to C, then\nthere is a path from A to C). Past research focused on whether transformers can\nlearn to infer transitivity from in-context examples provided in the input\nprompt.

In this\nstudy, we seek to answer this question by generating directed graphs to train\ntransformer models of varying sizes and evaluate their ability to infer\ntransitive relations for various graph sizes. Our findings suggest that\ntransformers are capable of learning connectivity on \"grid-like'' directed\ngraphs where each node can be embedded in a low-dimensional subspace, and\nconnectivity is easily inferable from the embeddings of the nodes. We find that\nthe dimensionality of the underlying grid graph is a strong predictor of\ntransformers' ability to learn the connectivity task, where higher-dimensional\ngrid graphs pose a greater challenge than low-dimensional grid graphs. In\naddition, we observe that increasing the model scale leads to increasingly\nbetter generalization to infer connectivity over grid graphs.

But can a unified theoretical framework be\nfound to underlie them both? Here we show that the equations used to describe\nneuronal avalanches in living brains can also be applied to cascades of\nactivity in deep neural networks. These equations are derived from\nnon-equilibrium statistical physics and show that deep neural networks learn\nbest when poised between absorbing and active phases. Because these networks\nare strongly driven by inputs, however, they do not operate at a true critical\npoint but within a quasi-critical regime -- one that still approximately\nsatisfies crackling noise scaling relations. By training networks with\ndifferent initializations, we show that maximal susceptibility is a more\nreliable predictor of learning than proximity to the critical point itself.\nThis provides a blueprint for engineering improved network performance.\nFinally, using finite-size scaling we identify distinct universality classes,\nincluding Barkhausen noise and directed percolation. This theoretical framework\ndemonstrates that universal features are shared by both biological and\nartificial neural networks."}

We\nintroduce VoiceAssistant-Eval, a comprehensive benchmark designed to assess AI\nassistants across listening, speaking, and viewing. VoiceAssistant-Eval\ncomprises 10,497 curated examples spanning 13 task categories. These tasks\ninclude natural sounds, music, and spoken dialogue for listening; multi-turn\ndialogue, role-play imitation, and various scenarios for speaking; and highly\nheterogeneous images for viewing. To demonstrate its utility, we evaluate 21\nopen-source models and GPT-4o-Audio, measuring the quality of the response\ncontent and speech, as well as their consistency. The results reveal three key\nfindings: (1) proprietary models do not universally outperform open-source\nmodels; (2) most models excel at speaking tasks but lag in audio understanding;\nand (3) well-designed smaller models can rival much larger ones. Notably, the\nmid-sized Step-Audio-2-mini (7B) achieves more than double the listening\naccuracy of LLaMA-Omni2-32B-Bilingual. However, challenges remain: multimodal\n(audio plus visual) input and role-play voice imitation tasks are difficult for\ncurrent models, and significant gaps persist in robustness and safety\nalignment. VoiceAssistant-Eval identifies these gaps and establishes a rigorous\nframework for evaluating and guiding the development of next-generation AI\nassistants.

Project page: https://spf-web.pages.dev", "summary": "We present See, Point, Fly (SPF), a training-free aerial vision-and-language\nnavigation (AVLN) framework built atop vision-language models (VLMs). SPF is\ncapable of navigating to any goal based on any type of free-form instructions\nin any kind of environment. In contrast to existing VLM-based approaches that\ntreat action prediction as a text generation task, our key insight is to\nconsider action prediction for AVLN as a 2D spatial grounding task. SPF\nharnesses VLMs to decompose vague language instructions into iterative\nannotation of 2D waypoints on the input image. Along with the predicted\ntraveling distance, SPF transforms predicted 2D waypoints into 3D displacement\nvectors as action commands for UAVs. Moreover, SPF also adaptively adjusts the\ntraveling distance to facilitate more efficient navigation. Notably, SPF\nperforms navigation in a closed-loop control manner, enabling UAVs to follow\ndynamic targets in dynamic environments. SPF sets a new state of the art in DRL\nsimulation benchmark, outperforming the previous best method by an absolute\nmargin of 63%. In extensive real-world evaluations, SPF outperforms strong\nbaselines by a large margin. We also conduct comprehensive ablation studies to\nhighlight the effectiveness of our design choice. Lastly, SPF shows remarkable\ngeneralization to different VLMs. Project page: https://spf-web.pages.dev"}
