Despite current advancements in reinforcement fine-tuning\n(RFT) showing strong performance in enhancing reasoning in LLMs, its potential\nto enable self-evolving embodied intelligence with multi-modal interactions\nremains largely unexplored. Specifically, reinforcement fine-tuning faces two\nfundamental obstacles in embodied settings: (i) the lack of accessible\nintermediate rewards in multi-step reasoning tasks limits effective learning\nsignals, and (ii) reliance on hand-crafted reward functions restricts\ngeneralization to novel tasks and environments. To address these challenges, we\npresent Self-Evolving Embodied Agents-R1, SEEA-R1, the first RFT framework\ndesigned for enabling the self-evolving capabilities of embodied agents.\nSpecifically, to convert sparse delayed rewards into denser intermediate\nsignals that improve multi-step reasoning, we propose Tree-based group relative\npolicy optimization (Tree-GRPO), which integrates Monte Carlo Tree Search into\nGRPO. To generalize reward estimation across tasks and scenes, supporting\nautonomous adaptation and reward-driven self-evolution, we further introduce\nMulti-modal Generative Reward Model (MGRM). To holistically evaluate the\neffectiveness of SEEA-R1, we evaluate on the ALFWorld benchmark, surpassing\nstate-of-the-art methods with scores of 85.07% (textual) and 36.19%\n(multi-modal), outperforming prior models including GPT-4o.

This concept shifts the\nfocus from rigid, prescripted test cases to flexible, on-demand logical queries\nagainst a unified data representation. Specifically, we identify the need for a\nfundamental improvement in data storage and representation, leading to our\nproposal of \"Extensible Scenarios Notations\" (ESN). ESN is a novel declarative\ndata framework based on Answer Set Programming (ASP), which uniformly\nrepresents heterogeneous multimodal data from the cockpit, vehicle, and road as\na collection of logical facts and rules. This approach not only achieves deep\nsemantic fusion of data, but also brings three core advantages: (1) supports\ncomplex and flexible semantic querying through logical reasoning; (2) provides\nnatural interpretability for decision-making processes; (3) allows for\non-demand data abstraction through logical rules, enabling fine-grained privacy\nprotection. We further elaborate on the QaT paradigm, transforming the\nfunctional validation and safety compliance checks of autonomous driving\nsystems into logical queries against the ESN database, significantly enhancing\nthe expressiveness and formal rigor of the testing.

However, few works have paid attention to the error-bias with\nrespect to error distribution of facial landmarks. In this paper, we\ninvestigate the error-bias issue in face alignment, where the distributions of\nlandmark errors tend to spread along the tangent line to landmark curves. This\nerror-bias is not trivial since it is closely connected to the ambiguous\nlandmark labeling task. Inspired by this observation, we seek a way to leverage\nthe error-bias property for better convergence of CNN model. To this end, we\npropose anisotropic direction loss (ADL) and anisotropic attention module (AAM)\nfor coordinate and heatmap regression, respectively. ADL imposes strong binding\nforce in normal direction for each landmark point on facial boundaries. On the\nother hand, AAM is an attention module which can get anisotropic attention mask\nfocusing on the region of point and its local edge connected by adjacent\npoints, it has a stronger response in tangent than in normal, which means\nrelaxed constraints in the tangent. These two methods work in a complementary\nmanner to learn both facial structures and texture details. Finally, we\nintegrate them into an optimized end-to-end training pipeline named ADNet.

It uses a\ntwo-step pipeline: (1) type-aware coreference resolution via sequential,\nstructured LLM prompts, and (2) entity and relationship extraction using\ndomain-guided instructions, built on an adapted GraphRAG framework. CORE-KG\nreduces node duplication by 33.28%, and legal noise by 38.37% compared to a\nGraphRAG-based baseline-resulting in cleaner and more coherent graph\nstructures.

Such\nmultidimensional settings are not merely of theoretical interest but are\ncentral to many real-world applications. For example, cloud computing resources\nare evaluated based on multiple criteria such as CPU cores, memory, and network\nbandwidth. In such cases, traditional one dimensional fairness notions fail to\ncapture fairness across multiple attributes. To address these challenges, we\nstudy two relaxed variants of envy-freeness: weak simultaneously envy-free up\nto c goods (weak sEFc) and strong simultaneously envy-free up to c goods\n(strong sEFc), which accommodate the multidimensionality of agents'\npreferences. Under the weak notion, for every pair of agents and for each\ndimension, any perceived envy can be eliminated by removing, if necessary, a\ndifferent set of goods from the envied agent's allocation. In contrast, the\nstrong version requires selecting a single set of goods whose removal from the\nenvied bundle simultaneously eliminates envy in every dimension. We provide\nupper and lower bounds on the relaxation parameter c that guarantee the\nexistence of weak or strong sEFc allocations, where these bounds are\nindependent of the total number of items. In addition, we present algorithms\nfor checking whether a weak or strong sEFc allocation exists. Moreover, we\nestablish NP-hardness results for checking the existence of weak sEF1 and\nstrong sEF1 allocations."}

We observe\nthat latent variable distributions in VAE exhibit overlap, which leads to an\noptimization conflict between the reconstruction loss and KL-divergence loss. A\nlower bound based on the overlap coefficient is proposed. We refer to this\nphenomenon as Mutually Exclusive Probability Spaces.

To further investigate structural changes, we include\npart of speech tagging in our analysis to quantify linguistic shifts over\ngrammatical categories and differentiate between word forms, like \"potential\"\nas a noun vs. as an adjective. We systematically analyze synonym groups for\nwidely discussed 'spiking words' based on frequency trends in scientific\nabstracts from PubMed.

However, existing\napproaches often rely on heuristic strategies for parallel sampling, lacking a\nprincipled foundation. To address this gap, we propose a probabilistic\nframework that formalizes the optimality of inference-time scaling under the\nassumption that parallel samples are independently and identically distributed\n(i.i.d.), and where the Best-of-N selection strategy follows a probability\ndistribution that can be estimated. Within this framework, we derive a\ntheoretical lower bound on the required number of samples to achieve a target\nperformance level, providing the first principled guidance for\ncompute-efficient scaling. Leveraging this insight, we develop\n\\textsc{OptScale}, a practical algorithm that dynamically determines the\noptimal number of sampled responses. \\textsc{OptScale} employs a language\nmodel-based predictor to estimate probabilistic prior parameters, enabling the\ndecision of the minimal number of samples needed that satisfy predefined\nperformance thresholds and confidence levels. Extensive experiments on\nmathematical reasoning benchmarks (including MATH-500, GSM8K, AIME, and AMC)\ndemonstrate that \\textsc{OptScale} significantly reduces sampling overhead\nwhile remaining better or on par with state-of-the-art reasoning performance.\nOur work offers both a theoretical foundation and a practical solution for\nprincipled inference-time scaling, addressing a critical gap in the efficient\ndeployment of LLMs for complex reasoning."}

In reality, conclusions are rarely set in stone; additional context\ncan strengthen or weaken an initial inference. To address this, we introduce\nDefeasible Video Entailment (DVidE), a new task that challenges models to think\nlike doubters, constantly updating their reasoning based on evolving evidence.\nIn DVidE, given a video premise and a textual hypothesis, models must determine\nwhether a new update strengthens or weakens the hypothesis (classification\nversion) or generate a coherent update that modifies the entailment\nrelationship (generation version). For solving the classification task, we\npropose the Chain of Counterfactual Thought framework, utilizing counterfactual\nreasoning, ASR-enhanced video content, and rationale refinement to reduce\ninference bias. For the generation task, we develop a framework that combines\nASR output with a Large Language Model (LLM) to produce coherent, contextually\nrelevant updates aligned with the intended strengthener or weakener goals.\nAdditionally, we introduce a novel benchmark dataset, with\nstrengthener/weakener annotations and an LLM-based evaluation metric\nspecifically designed for assessing generative performance.

Although high-end confocal microscopes are capable of filtering\nout-of-focus light, cheaper and more accessible microscopy modalities, such as\nwidefield microscopy, can not, which consequently leads to hazy image data.\nComputational dehazing is trying to combine the best of both worlds, leading to\ncheap microscopy but crisp-looking images. The perception-distortion trade-off\ntells us that we can optimize either for data fidelity, e.g. low MSE or high\nPSNR, or for data realism, measured by perceptual metrics such as LPIPS or FID.\nExisting methods either prioritize fidelity at the expense of realism, or\nproduce perceptually convincing results that lack quantitative accuracy. In\nthis work, we propose HazeMatching, a novel iterative method for dehazing light\nmicroscopy images, which effectively balances these objectives. Our goal was to\nfind a balanced trade-off between the fidelity of the dehazing results and the\nrealism of individual predictions (samples). We achieve this by adapting the\nconditional flow matching framework by guiding the generative process with a\nhazy observation in the conditional velocity field. We evaluate HazeMatching on\n5 datasets, covering both synthetic and real data, assessing both distortion\nand perceptual quality. Our method is compared against 7 baselines, achieving a\nconsistent balance between fidelity and realism on average. Additionally, with\ncalibration analysis, we show that HazeMatching produces well-calibrated\npredictions. Note that our method does not need an explicit degradation\noperator to exist, making it easily applicable on real microscopy data.

Based on these\nembeddings, CLoVE is able to iteratively identify and separate clients from\ndifferent clusters and optimize cluster-specific models through federated\naggregation. Key advantages of CLoVE over existing CFL algorithms are (1) its\nsimplicity, (2) its applicability to both supervised and unsupervised settings,\nand (3) the fact that it eliminates the need for near-optimal model\ninitialization, which makes it more robust and better suited for real-world\napplications.
