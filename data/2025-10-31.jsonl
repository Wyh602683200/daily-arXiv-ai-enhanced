While effective for decision-making, these\noutputs obscure the underlying contributions of individual pieces or patterns.\nIn this paper, we explore adapting SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations) to the\ndomain of chess analysis, aiming to attribute a chess engines evaluation to\nspecific pieces on the board. By treating pieces as features and systematically\nablating them, we compute additive, per-piece contributions that explain the\nengines output in a locally faithful and human-interpretable manner.

We introduce a\ntwo-level framework to address this gap. The Information-Theoretic Imperative\n(ITI) establishes that any system persisting in uncertain environments must\nminimize epistemic entropy through predictive compression: this is the\nevolutionary \"why\" linking survival pressure to information-processing demands.\nThe Compression Efficiency Principle (CEP) specifies how efficient compression\nmechanically selects for generative, causal models through\nexception-accumulation dynamics, making reality alignment a consequence rather\nthan a contingent achievement. Together, ITI and CEP define a causal chain:\nfrom survival pressure to prediction necessity, compression requirement,\nefficiency optimization, generative structure discovery, and ultimately reality\nalignment. Each link follows from physical, information-theoretic, or\nevolutionary constraints, implying that intelligence is the mechanically\nnecessary outcome of persistence in structured environments. This framework\nyields empirically testable predictions: compression efficiency, measured as\napproach to the rate-distortion frontier, correlates with out-of-distribution\ngeneralization; exception-accumulation rates differentiate causal from\ncorrelational models; hierarchical systems exhibit increasing efficiency across\nabstraction layers; and biological systems demonstrate metabolic costs that\ntrack representational complexity.

These datasets\ncapture valuable insights, but their scale and structure present a unique\nchallenge for large language models (LLMs), which otherwise excel at few-shot\nreasoning over open-ended text. Yet, their ability to process questionnaire\ndata or lists of questions crossed with hundreds of respondent rows remains\nunderexplored. Current retrieval and survey analysis tools (e.g., Qualtrics,\nSPSS, REDCap) are typically designed for humans in the workflow, limiting such\ndata integration with LLM and AI-empowered automation. This gap leaves\nscientists, surveyors, and everyday users without evidence-based guidance on\nhow to best represent questionnaires for LLM consumption. We address this by\nintroducing QASU (Questionnaire Analysis and Structural Understanding), a\nbenchmark that probes six structural skills, including answer lookup,\nrespondent count, and multi-hop inference, across six serialization formats and\nmultiple prompt strategies.

Regulatory texts (e.g., the General Data Protection\nRegulation, GDPR) are cross-referential and normative, while runtime contexts\nare expressed in unstructured natural language. This setting motivates us to\nalign semantic information in unstructured text with the structured, normative\nelements of regulations. To this end, we introduce GraphCompliance, a framework\nthat represents regulatory texts as a Policy Graph and runtime contexts as a\nContext Graph, and aligns them. In this formulation, the policy graph encodes\nnormative structure and cross-references, whereas the context graph formalizes\nevents as subject-action-object (SAO) and entity-relation triples. This\nalignment anchors the reasoning of a judge large language model (LLM) in\nstructured information and helps reduce the burden of regulatory interpretation\nand event parsing, enabling a focus on the core reasoning step. In experiments\non 300 GDPR-derived real-world scenarios spanning five evaluation tasks,\nGraphCompliance yields 4.1-7.2 percentage points (pp) higher micro-F1 than\nLLM-only and RAG baselines, with fewer under- and over-predictions, resulting\nin higher recall and lower false positive rates.

Evaluation across three open-source models\nusing real Austrian day-ahead electricity prices reveals substantial capability\ndifferences. Llama-3.3-70B successfully coordinates all appliances across all\nscenarios to match cost-optimal benchmarks computed via mixed-integer linear\nprogramming, while other models achieve perfect single-appliance performance\nbut struggle to coordinate all appliances simultaneously. Progressive prompt\nengineering experiments demonstrate that analytical query handling without\nexplicit guidance remains unreliable despite models' general reasoning\ncapabilities. We open-source the complete system including orchestration logic,\nagent prompts, tools, and web interfaces to enable reproducibility, extension,\nand future research."}

While large language models (LLMs)\nhave demonstrated remarkable performance across various reasoning tasks, their\nability to handle normative reasoning remains underexplored. In this paper, we\nsystematically evaluate LLMs' reasoning capabilities in the normative domain\nfrom both logical and modal perspectives. Specifically, to assess how well LLMs\nreason with normative modals, we make a comparison between their reasoning with\nnormative modals and their reasoning with epistemic modals, which share a\ncommon formal structure. To this end, we introduce a new dataset covering a\nwide range of formal patterns of reasoning in both normative and epistemic\ndomains, while also incorporating non-formal cognitive factors that influence\nhuman reasoning. Our results indicate that, although LLMs generally adhere to\nvalid reasoning patterns, they exhibit notable inconsistencies in specific\ntypes of normative reasoning and display cognitive biases similar to those\nobserved in psychological studies of human reasoning.

Unlike conventional approaches that search\nfor optimal parameters within a fixed geometric space, our core idea is to\ntreat the model itself as a malleable geometric entity. Specifically, we\noptimize the metric tensor field on a manifold with a predefined topology,\nthereby dynamically shaping the geometric structure of the model space. To\nachieve this, we construct a variational framework whose loss function\ncarefully balances data fidelity against the intrinsic geometric complexity of\nthe manifold. The former ensures the model effectively explains observed data,\nwhile the latter acts as a regularizer, penalizing overly curved or irregular\ngeometries to encourage simpler models and prevent overfitting. To address the\ncomputational challenges of this infinite-dimensional optimization problem, we\nintroduce a practical method based on discrete differential geometry: the\ncontinuous manifold is discretized into a triangular mesh, and the metric\ntensor is parameterized by edge lengths, enabling efficient optimization using\nautomatic differentiation tools. Theoretical analysis reveals a profound\nanalogy between our framework and the Einstein-Hilbert action in general\nrelativity, providing an elegant physical interpretation for the concept of\n\"data-driven geometry\".

As this failure originates in\nuniform and context agnostic updates, effective control demands explicit token\nordering. We propose Token Timestep Allocation (TTA), which realizes soft and\nsemantic token ordering via per token timestep schedules: critical tokens are\nfrozen early, while uncertain tokens receive continued refinement. This\ntimestep based ordering can be instantiated as either a fixed policy or an\nadaptive policy driven by task signals, thereby supporting a broad spectrum of\nrefinement strategies.

To\naddress this, AMO-Bench introduces more rigorous challenges by ensuring all 50\nproblems are (1) cross-validated by experts to meet at least the International\nMathematical Olympiad (IMO) difficulty standards, and (2) entirely original\nproblems to prevent potential performance leakages from data memorization.\nMoreover, each problem in AMO-Bench requires only a final answer rather than a\nproof, enabling automatic and robust grading for evaluation. Experimental\nresults across 26 LLMs on AMO-Bench show that even the best-performing model\nachieves only 52.4% accuracy on AMO-Bench, with most LLMs scoring below 40%.\nBeyond these poor performances, our further analysis reveals a promising\nscaling trend with increasing test-time compute on AMO-Bench. These results\nhighlight the significant room for improving the mathematical reasoning in\ncurrent LLMs. We release AMO-Bench to facilitate further research into\nadvancing the reasoning abilities of language models.\nhttps://amo-bench.github.io/"}

To address this, we propose two advanced sampling\ntechniques based on features and logits. These samplers select a small yet\nrepresentative subset of the entire dataset by considering the stochastic\ndistribution of features or logits, thereby enhancing the accuracy of IF\nestimations. We validate our approach through class removal experiments, a\ntypical application of IFs, using the F1-score to measure how effectively the\nmodel forgets the removed class while maintaining inference consistency on the\nremaining classes.

Accurate world models are essential for\nenabling agents to think, plan, and reason effectively in complex, dynamic\nsettings. Despite rapid progress, current world models remain brittle and\ndegrade over long horizons. We argue that a central cause is representation\nquality: exteroceptive inputs (e.g., images) are high-dimensional, and lossy or\nentangled latents make dynamics learning unnecessarily hard. We therefore ask\nwhether improving representation learning alone can substantially improve\nworld-model performance. In this work, we take a step toward building a truly\naccurate world model by addressing a fundamental yet open problem: constructing\na model that can fully clone and overfit to a deterministic 3D world. We\npropose Geometrically-Regularized World Models (GRWM), which enforces that\nconsecutive points along a natural sensory trajectory remain close in latent\nrepresentation space. This approach yields significantly improved latent\nrepresentations that align closely with the true topology of the environment.\nGRWM is plug-and-play, requires only minimal architectural modification, scales\nwith trajectory length, and is compatible with diverse latent generative\nbackbones. Across deterministic 3D settings and long-horizon prediction tasks,\nGRWM significantly increases rollout fidelity and stability. Analyses show that\nits benefits stem from learning a latent manifold with superior geometric\nstructure. These findings support a clear takeaway: improving representation\nlearning is a direct and useful path to robust world models, delivering\nreliable long-horizon predictions without enlarging the dynamics module."}

Yet, an important question still\nremains: Are video models ready to serve as zero-shot reasoners in challenging\nvisual reasoning scenarios? In this work, we conduct an empirical study to\ncomprehensively investigate this question, focusing on the leading and popular\nVeo-3. We evaluate its reasoning behavior across 12 dimensions, including\nspatial, geometric, physical, temporal, and embodied logic, systematically\ncharacterizing both its strengths and failure modes. To standardize this study,\nwe curate the evaluation data into MME-CoF, a compact benchmark that enables\nin-depth and thorough assessment of Chain-of-Frame (CoF) reasoning. Our\nfindings reveal that while current video models demonstrate promising reasoning\npatterns on short-horizon spatial coherence, fine-grained grounding, and\nlocally consistent dynamics, they remain limited in long-horizon causal\nreasoning, strict geometric constraints, and abstract logic.
