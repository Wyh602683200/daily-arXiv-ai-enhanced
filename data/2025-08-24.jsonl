Its\nacquisition is often believed to rely on world models, comprising both\ndescriptive (what is) and prescriptive (what is desirable) aspects that\nidentify and evaluate state of affairs in the world, respectively. Canonical\ncomputational accounts of purposeful behavior, such as reinforcement learning,\nposit distinct components of a world model comprising a state representation\n(descriptive aspect) and a reward function (prescriptive aspect). However, an\nalternative possibility, which has not yet been computationally formulated, is\nthat these two aspects instead co-emerge interdependently from an agent's goal.\nHere, we describe a computational framework of goal-directed state\nrepresentation in cognitive agents, in which the descriptive and prescriptive\naspects of a world model co-emerge from agent-environment interaction\nsequences, or experiences. Drawing on Buddhist epistemology, we introduce a\nconstruct of goal-directed, or telic, states, defined as classes of\ngoal-equivalent experience distributions.

We observe that human navigation\nand movement in crowds are often influenced by complex social and environmental\ninteractions, driven mainly by language and dialogue. However, most existing\nwork does not consider these dimensions and leads to animations where\nagent-agent and agent-environment interactions are largely limited to steering\nand fixed higher-level goal extrapolation.\n  We propose a novel method that exploits large language models (LLMs) to\ncontrol agents' movement. Our method has two main components: a dialogue system\nand language-driven navigation. We periodically query agent-centric LLMs\nconditioned on character personalities, roles, desires, and relationships to\ncontrol the generation of inter-agent dialogue when necessitated by the spatial\nand social relationships with neighbouring agents. We then use the conversation\nand each agent's personality, emotional state, vision, and physical state to\ncontrol the navigation and steering of each agent. Our model thus enables\nagents to make motion decisions based on both their perceptual inputs and the\nongoing dialogue.\n  We validate our method in two complex scenarios that exemplify the interplay\nbetween social interactions, steering, and crowding. In these scenarios, we\nobserve that grouping and ungrouping of agents automatically occur.\nAdditionally, our experiments show that our method serves as an\ninformation-passing mechanism within the crowd. As a result, our framework\nproduces more realistic crowd simulations, with emergent group behaviours\narising naturally from any environmental setting."}

In this study, we systematically\ninvestigate the impact of input resolution on the accuracy and robustness of\nthree prominent deep learning-based face detectors: YOLOv11, YOLOv12, and\nMTCNN. Using the WIDER FACE dataset, we conduct extensive evaluations across\nmultiple image resolutions (160x160, 320x320, and 640x640) and assess each\nmodel's performance using metrics such as precision, recall, mAP50, mAP50-95,\nand inference time. Results indicate that YOLOv11 outperforms YOLOv12 and MTCNN\nin terms of detection accuracy, especially at higher resolutions, while YOLOv12\nexhibits slightly better recall. MTCNN, although competitive in landmark\nlocalization, lags in real-time inference speed. Our findings provide\nactionable insights for selecting resolution-aware face detection models\nsuitable for varying operational constraints."}

In this work,\nwe propose \\textbf{SemToken}, a semantic-aware tokenization framework that\njointly reduces token redundancy and improves computation efficiency. SemToken\nfirst extracts contextual semantic embeddings via lightweight encoders and\nperforms local semantic clustering to merge semantically equivalent tokens.\nThen, it allocates heterogeneous token granularity based on semantic density,\nallowing finer-grained tokenization in content-rich regions and coarser\ncompression in repetitive or low-entropy spans. SemToken can be seamlessly\nintegrated with modern language models and attention acceleration methods.\nExperiments on long-context language modeling benchmarks such as WikiText-103\nand LongBench show that SemToken achieves up to $2.4\\times$ reduction in token\ncount and $1.9\\times$ speedup, with negligible or no degradation in perplexity\nand downstream accuracy. Our findings suggest that semantic structure offers a\npromising new axis for optimizing tokenization and computation in large\nlanguage models."}

However,\nexisting methods face two critical yet under-explored issues: Structural Visit\nBias, where random walk sampling disproportionately emphasizes high-degree\nnodes, leading to redundant and noisy structural representations; and Abrupt\nEvolution Blindness, the failure to effectively detect sudden structural\nchanges due to rigid or overly simplistic temporal modeling strategies,\nresulting in inconsistent temporal embeddings. To overcome these challenges, we\npropose EvoFormer, an evolution-aware Transformer framework tailored for\ndynamic graph-level representation learning. To mitigate Structural Visit Bias,\nEvoFormer introduces a Structure-Aware Transformer Module that incorporates\npositional encoding based on node structural roles, allowing the model to\nglobally differentiate and accurately represent node structures. To overcome\nAbrupt Evolution Blindness, EvoFormer employs an Evolution-Sensitive Temporal\nModule, which explicitly models temporal evolution through a sequential\nthree-step strategy: (I) Random Walk Timestamp Classification, generating\ninitial timestamp-aware graph-level embeddings; (II) Graph-Level Temporal\nSegmentation, partitioning the graph stream into segments reflecting\nstructurally coherent periods; and (III) Segment-Aware Temporal Self-Attention\ncombined with an Edge Evolution Prediction task, enabling the model to\nprecisely capture segment boundaries and perceive structural evolution trends,\neffectively adapting to rapid temporal shifts. Extensive evaluations on five\nbenchmark datasets confirm that EvoFormer achieves state-of-the-art performance\nin graph similarity ranking, temporal anomaly detection, and temporal\nsegmentation tasks, validating its effectiveness in correcting structural and\ntemporal biases."}

Lung ultrasound (LUS) is a prime example-it\nfrequently presents a mixture of highly ambiguous regions and clearly\ndiscernible structures, making consistent annotation challenging even for\nexperienced clinicians. In this work, we introduce a novel approach to both\nlabeling and training AI models using expert-supplied, per-pixel confidence\nvalues. Rather than treating annotations as absolute ground truth, we design a\ndata annotation protocol that captures the confidence that radiologists have in\neach labeled region, modeling the inherent aleatoric uncertainty present in\nreal-world clinical data. We demonstrate that incorporating these confidence\nvalues during training leads to improved segmentation performance. More\nimportantly, we show that this enhanced segmentation quality translates into\nbetter performance on downstream clinically-critical tasks-specifically,\nestimating S/F oxygenation ratio values, classifying S/F ratio change, and\npredicting 30-day patient readmission. While we empirically evaluate many\nmethods for exposing the uncertainty to the learning model, we find that a\nsimple approach that trains a model on binarized labels obtained with a (60%)\nconfidence threshold works well. Importantly, high thresholds work far better\nthan a naive approach of a 50% threshold, indicating that training on very\nconfident pixels is far more effective. Our study systematically investigates\nthe impact of training with varying confidence thresholds, comparing not only\nsegmentation metrics but also downstream clinical outcomes. These results\nsuggest that label confidence is a valuable signal that, when properly\nleveraged, can significantly enhance the reliability and clinical utility of AI\nin medical imaging."}
