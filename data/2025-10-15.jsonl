We present GSSBench, a task suite of prompt pairs with\nground-truth GSS relationships to assess different metrics and understand where\nmodels diverge from desired behavior. We find that hallucination detection\nmetrics, particularly EigenScore, consistently outperform standard diversity\nand uncertainty quantification metrics, while using only model internals,\nproviding interpretable insights into a model's internal task representations.\nWe demonstrate three applications of GSS: (1) detecting prompt ambiguity and\npredicting clarification questions for better grounding, (2) interpreting\noverthinking and underthinking in reasoning models, and (3) steering models to\nexpand their generation space to yield high-quality and diverse outputs."}

Yet, their adoption in\npractice has been hampered by the lack of such specifications in real world\ncode. Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown promise in inferring formal\npostconditions from natural language hints embedded in code such as function\nnames, comments or documentation. Using the generated postconditions as\nspecifications in a subsequent verification, however, often leads verifiers to\nsuggest invalid inputs, hinting at potential issues that ultimately turn out to\nbe false alarms.\n  To address this, we revisit the problem of specification inference from\nnatural language in the context of automatic software verification. In the\nprocess, we introduce NL2Contract, the task of employing LLMs to translate\ninformal natural language into formal functional contracts, consisting of\npostconditions as well as preconditions. We introduce metrics to validate and\ncompare different NL2Contract approaches, using soundness, bug discriminative\npower of the generated contracts and their usability in the context of\nautomatic software verification as key metrics. We evaluate NL2Contract with\ndifferent LLMs and compare it to the task of postcondition generation\nnl2postcond.
