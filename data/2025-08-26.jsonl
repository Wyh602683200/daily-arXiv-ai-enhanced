While recent advances in deep learning have\npushed the boundaries of automatic speech dysfluency detection, rule-based\napproaches remain crucial for clinical applications where interpretability and\ntransparency are paramount. This paper presents a comprehensive analysis of\nrule-based stuttering detection systems, synthesizing insights from multiple\ncorpora including UCLASS, FluencyBank, and SEP-28k. We propose an enhanced\nrule-based framework that incorporates speaking-rate normalization, multi-level\nacoustic feature analysis, and hierarchical decision structures. Our approach\nachieves competitive performance while maintaining complete\ninterpretability-critical for clinical adoption. We demonstrate that rule-based\nsystems excel particularly in prolongation detection (97-99% accuracy) and\nprovide stable performance across varying speaking rates. Furthermore, we show\nhow these interpretable models can be integrated with modern machine learning\npipelines as proposal generators or constraint modules, bridging the gap\nbetween traditional speech pathology practices and contemporary AI systems.

To facilitate the\nevaluation of plausibility, we construct a new rationale-annotated dataset,\noffering denser annotations with diverse granularity and aligns better with\ncurrent clinical practice, and conduct evaluation across three types of\nrationales of ICD coding.

In this work, we utilize a Bayesian\nframework to quantify sycophancy as deviations from rational behavior when\npresented with user perspectives, thus distinguishing between rational and\nirrational updates based on the introduction of user perspectives. In\ncomparison to other methods, this approach allows us to characterize excessive\nbehavioral shifts, even for tasks that involve inherent uncertainty or do not\nhave a ground truth. We study sycophancy for 3 different tasks, a combination\nof open-source and closed LLMs, and two different methods for probing\nsycophancy.

However, there is still ambiguity lingering on the\nreliable evaluations for the users and nature of transparency in the\nexplanations provided for the decisions made by black-boxed AI. To solve the\nblackbox nature of Machine Learning based Intrusion Detection Systems, a\nframework is proposed in this paper to give an explanation for IDSs decision\nmaking. This framework uses Local Interpretable Model-Agnostic Explanations\n(LIME) coupled with Explain Like I'm five (ELI5) and Decision Tree algorithms\nto provide local and global explanations and improve the interpretation of\nIDSs. The local explanations provide the justification for the decision made on\na specific input.

In addition,\nthis framework brings transparency in the field of ML driven IDS that might be\nhighly significant for wide scale adoption of eXplainable AI in cyber-critical\nsystems.

In\ncontrast, temporal high-frequency measurements of spatially sparse wall\npressure are more readily accessible in wind tunnel experiments. In this study,\nwe propose a novel cross-modal temporal upscaling framework, LatentFlow, which\nreconstructs high-frequency (512 Hz) turbulent wake flow fields by fusing\nsynchronized low-frequency (15 Hz) flow field and pressure data during\ntraining, and high-frequency wall pressure signals during inference. The first\nstage involves training a pressure-conditioned $\\beta$-variation autoencoder\n($p$C-$\\beta$-VAE) to learn a compact latent representation that captures the\nintrinsic dynamics of the wake flow. A secondary network maps synchronized\nlow-frequency wall pressure signals into the latent space, enabling\nreconstruction of the wake flow field solely from sparse wall pressure. Once\ntrained, the model utilizes high-frequency, spatially sparse wall pressure\ninputs to generate corresponding high-frequency flow fields via the\n$p$C-$\\beta$-VAE decoder. By decoupling the spatial encoding of flow dynamics\nfrom temporal pressure measurements, LatentFlow provides a scalable and robust\nsolution for reconstructing high-frequency turbulent wake flows in\ndata-constrained experimental settings."}

Model compression techniques\nare essential for making these models practical for resource-constrained\nenvironments.

However, standard SVD focuses on minimizing matrix\nreconstruction error, often leading to a substantial loss of the model's\nfunctional performance. This performance degradation occurs because existing\nmethods do not adequately correct for the functional information lost during\ncompression. To address this gap, we introduce Corrective Adaptive Low-Rank\nDecomposition (CALR), a two-component compression approach.

It focuses on the deep\ndisagreements over whether artificial general intelligence (AGI) will prove\ntransformative for human society; a question that is analytically prior to that\nof whether this transformative effect will help or harm humanity. The study\nbegins by distinguishing two fundamental camps in this debate. The first of\nthese can be identified as \"transformationalists,\" who argue that continued AI\ndevelopment will inevitably have a profound effect on society. Opposed to them\nare \"skeptics,\" a more eclectic group united by their disbelief that AI can or\nwill live up to such high expectations. Each camp admits further \"strong\" and\n\"weak\" variants depending on their tolerance for epistemic risk. These stylized\ncontrasts help to identify a set of fundamental questions that shape the camps'\nrespective interpretations of the future of AI. Three questions in particular\nare focused on: the possibility of non-biological intelligence, the appropriate\ntime frame of technological predictions, and the assumed trajectory of\ntechnological development. In highlighting these specific points of\nnon-technical disagreement, this study demonstrates the wide range of different\narguments used to justify either the transformationalist or skeptical position.\nAt the same time, it highlights the strong argumentative burden of the\ntransformationalist position, the way that belief in this position creates\ncompetitive pressures to achieve first-mover advantage, and the need to widen\nthe concept of \"expertise\" in debates surrounding the future development of AI."}

A common but often implicit\nassumption is that CoT traces should be semantically meaningful and\ninterpretable to the end user. While recent research questions the need for\nsemantic nature of these traces, in this paper, we ask: ``\\textit{Must CoT\nreasoning traces be interpretable to enhance LLM task performance?}\" We\ninvestigate this question in the Open Book Question-Answering domain by\nsupervised fine-tuning LLaMA and Qwen models on four types of reasoning traces:\n(1) DeepSeek R1 traces, (2) LLM-generated summaries of R1 traces, (3)\nLLM-generated post-hoc explanations of R1 traces, and (4) algorithmically\ngenerated verifiably correct traces.

RoentGen-v2 is the first\nmodel to generate clinically plausible images with demographic conditioning,\nfacilitating the creation of a large, demographically balanced synthetic\ndataset comprising over 565,000 images. We use this large synthetic dataset to\nevaluate optimal training pipelines for downstream disease classification\nmodels. In contrast to prior work that combines real and synthetic data\nnaively, we propose an improved training strategy that leverages synthetic data\nfor supervised pretraining, followed by fine-tuning on real data. Through\nextensive evaluation on over 137,000 chest radiographs from five institutions,\nwe demonstrate that synthetic pretraining consistently improves model\nperformance, generalization to out-of-distribution settings, and fairness\nacross demographic subgroups. Across datasets, synthetic pretraining led to a\n6.5% accuracy increase in the performance of downstream classification models,\ncompared to a modest 2.7% increase when naively combining real and synthetic\ndata. We observe this performance improvement simultaneously with the reduction\nof the underdiagnosis fairness gap by 19.3%. These results highlight the\npotential of synthetic imaging to advance equitable and generalizable medical\ndeep learning under real-world data constraints.

Our findings\nreveal that the impact of quantization on model calibration is generally minor.\nAnalysis of neuron activations indicates that the number of dead neurons, i.e.,\nthose with activation values close to 0 across the dataset, remains consistent\nregardless of quantization. In terms of neuron contribution to predictions, we\nobserve that smaller full precision models exhibit fewer salient neurons,\nwhereas larger models tend to have more, with the exception of Llama-2-7B.

Due to the rich\nvisual information, a single image can generate thousands of vision tokens,\nleading to high computational costs during the prefilling stage and significant\nmemory overhead during decoding. Existing methods attempt to prune redundant\nvision tokens, revealing substantial redundancy in visual representations.\nHowever, these methods often struggle in shallow layers due to the lack of\nsufficient contextual information. We argue that many visual tokens are\ninherently redundant even in shallow layers and can be safely and effectively\npruned with appropriate contextual signals. In this work, we propose CoViPAL, a\nlayer-wise contextualized visual token pruning method that employs a\nPlug-and-Play Pruning Module (PPM) to predict and remove redundant vision\ntokens before they are processed by the LVLM. The PPM is lightweight,\nmodel-agnostic, and operates independently of the LVLM architecture, ensuring\nseamless integration with various models. Extensive experiments on multiple\nbenchmarks demonstrate that CoViPAL outperforms training-free pruning methods\nunder equal token budgets and surpasses training-based methods with comparable\nsupervision. CoViPAL offers a scalable and efficient solution to improve\ninference efficiency in LVLMs without compromising accuracy."}

To address these issues, we\npropose FedKLPR, a lightweight and communication-efficient federated learning\nframework for person re-identification.

Secondly, KL-Divergence-Prune Weighted\nAggregation (KLPWA) integrates pruning ratio and distributional similarity into\nthe aggregation process, thereby improving the robustness of the global model\nwhile significantly reducing communication overhead. Furthermore, sparse\nActivation Skipping (SAS) mitigates the dilution of critical parameters during\nthe aggregation of pruned client models by excluding zero-valued weights from\nthe update process.

Nevertheless, effectively aligning them with desired\nbehaviors remains a significant challenge. Activation steering is an effective\nand cost-efficient approach that directly modifies the activations of LLMs\nduring the inference stage, aligning their responses with the desired behaviors\nand avoiding the high cost of fine-tuning. Existing methods typically\nindiscriminately intervene to all generations or rely solely on the question to\ndetermine intervention, which limits the accurate assessment of the\nintervention strength. To this end, we propose the Flexible Activation Steering\nwith Backtracking (FASB) framework, which dynamically determines both the\nnecessity and strength of intervention by tracking the internal states of the\nLLMs during generation, considering both the question and the generated\ncontent. Since intervening after detecting a deviation from the desired\nbehavior is often too late, we further propose the backtracking mechanism to\ncorrect the deviated tokens and steer the LLMs toward the desired behavior.\nExtensive experiments on the TruthfulQA dataset and six multiple-choice\ndatasets demonstrate that our method outperforms baselines.

Consequently, recorded brain signals become weaker,\nuncertain, and contain poor visual context over time. This paper presents one\nof the first vision-learning approaches to address this problem. First, we\nstatistically and experimentally demonstrate the existence of inconsistency in\nbrain signals and its impact on the Vision-Brain Understanding (VBU) model. Our\nfindings show that brain signal representations shift over recording sessions,\nleading to compounding bias, which poses challenges for model learning and\ndegrades performance. Then, we propose a new Bias-Mitigation Continual Learning\n(BRAIN) approach to address these limitations. In this approach, the model is\ntrained in a continual learning setup and mitigates the growing bias from each\nlearning step. A new loss function named De-bias Contrastive Learning is also\nintroduced to address the bias problem. In addition, to prevent catastrophic\nforgetting, where the model loses knowledge from previous sessions, the new\nAngular-based Forgetting Mitigation approach is introduced to preserve learned\nknowledge in the model. Finally, the empirical experiments demonstrate that our\napproach achieves State-of-the-Art (SOTA) performance across various\nbenchmarks, surpassing prior and non-continual learning methods."}

Such AI-based\nCV systems are becoming prevalent, with applications spanning from medical\nimaging to surveillance. State of the art models such as convolutional neural\nnetworks (CNNs) and vision transformers (ViTs) are often regarded as ``black\nboxes,'' offering limited transparency into their decision-making processes.\nDespite a recent advancement in explainable AI (XAI), explainability remains\nunderutilized in practical CV deployments. A primary obstacle is the absence of\nintegrated software solutions that connect XAI techniques with robust knowledge\nmanagement and monitoring frameworks. To close this gap, we have developed Obz\nAI, a comprehensive software ecosystem designed to facilitate state-of-the-art\nexplainability and observability for vision AI systems. Obz AI provides a\nseamless integration pipeline, from a Python client library to a full-stack\nanalytics dashboard. With Obz AI, a machine learning engineer can easily\nincorporate advanced XAI methodologies, extract and analyze features for\noutlier detection, and continuously monitor AI models in real time.

In deployments where transcripts are unavailable, standard pipelines\nstill yield derived call attributes such as Intent Summaries, Topic Flow, and\nQA Evaluation Forms. We leverage these as supervision signals to guide\ngeneration.

Specifically,\nwe express D as a function of the sensor coordinate matrix X that inherently\nsatisfies the unique properties of D, and then jointly recover D and X using a\ndeep neural network. To handle outliers effectively, we model them as a sparse\nmatrix L and add a regularization term of L into the optimization problem. We\nthen solve the problem by alternately updating X, D, and L. Numerical\nexperiments demonstrate that the proposed technique can recover the location\ninformation of sensors accurately even in the presence of outliers."}

To address this, we introduce MTalk-Bench, a multi-turn\nS2S benchmark covering three core dimensions: Semantic Information,\nParalinguistic Information, and Ambient Sound. Each dimension includes nine\nrealistic scenarios, along with targeted tasks to assess specific capabilities\nsuch as reasoning. Our dual-method evaluation framework combines Arena-style\nevaluation (pairwise comparison) and Rubrics-based evaluation (absolute\nscoring) for relative and absolute assessment. The benchmark includes both\nmodel and human outputs, evaluated by human evaluators and LLMs. Experimental\nresults reveal two sets of findings. Overall performance of S2S LLMs: (1)\nmodels excel at semantic information processing yet underperform on\nparalinguistic information and ambient sounds perception; (2) models typically\nregain coherence by increasing response length, sacrificing efficiency in\nmulti-turn dialogues; (3) modality-aware, task-specific designs outperform\nbrute scaling.

To this end, we propose a test-time trajectory optimization framework\nnamed SafeBimanual for any pre-trained diffusion-based bimanual manipulation\npolicies, which imposes the safety constraints on bimanual actions to avoid\ndangerous robot behaviors with improved success rate. Specifically, we design\ndiverse cost functions for safety constraints in different dual-arm cooperation\npatterns including avoidance of tearing objects and collision between arms and\nobjects, which optimizes the manipulator trajectories with guided sampling of\ndiffusion denoising process. Moreover, we employ a vision-language model (VLM)\nto schedule the cost functions by specifying keypoints and corresponding\npairwise relationship, so that the optimal safety constraint is dynamically\ngenerated in the entire bimanual manipulation process. SafeBimanual\ndemonstrates superiority on 8 simulated tasks in RoboTwin with a 13.7% increase\nin success rate and a 18.8% reduction in unsafe interactions over\nstate-of-the-art diffusion-based methods.
