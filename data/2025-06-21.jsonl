They also require human grounding in multi-modal environments,\nwhich can be ad-hoc, rigid, and brittle. Neural networks are good at extracting\nrich contextual information from multi-modal data, but lack interpretable\nstructures for reasoning.\n  Objectives: CALM aims to bridge the gap between logic and neural perception,\ncreating an analog logic that can reason over multi-modal inputs. Without this\nintegration, AI systems remain either brittle or unstructured, unable to\ngeneralize robustly to real-world tasks. In CALM, symbolic predicates evaluate\nto analog truth values computed by neural networks and constrained search.\n  Methods: CALM represents each predicate using a domain tree, which\niteratively refines its analog truth value when the contextual groundings of\nits entities are determined. The iterative refinement is predicted by neural\nnetworks capable of capturing multi-modal information and is filtered through a\nsymbolic reasoning module to ensure constraint satisfaction.\n  Results: In fill-in-the-blank object placement tasks, CALM achieved 92.2%\naccuracy, outperforming classical logic (86.3%) and LLM (59.4%) baselines. It\nalso demonstrated spatial heatmap generation aligned with logical constraints\nand delicate human preferences, as shown by a human study.\n  Conclusions: CALM demonstrates the potential to reason with logic structure\nwhile aligning with preferences in multi-modal environments. It lays the\nfoundation for next-gen AI systems that require the precision and\ninterpretation of logic and the multimodal information processing of neural\nnetworks."}

However,\nthe core challenge extends beyond simply detecting subtle artifacts; it\nrequires providing fine-grained, persuasive evidence that can convince auditors\nand end-users alike. To address this critical gap, we introduce DAVID-X, the\nfirst dataset to pair AI-generated videos with detailed defect-level,\ntemporal-spatial annotations and written rationales.

We\nbuilt FAHR-Face, a foundation model trained on >40 million facial images and\nfine-tuned it for two distinct tasks: biological age estimation (FAHR-FaceAge)\nand survival risk prediction (FAHR-FaceSurvival).\n  Methods: FAHR-FaceAge underwent a two-stage, age-balanced fine-tuning on\n749,935 public images; FAHR-FaceSurvival was fine-tuned on 34,389 photos of\ncancer patients. Model robustness (cosmetic surgery, makeup, pose, lighting)\nand independence (saliency mapping) was tested extensively. Both models were\nclinically tested in two independent cancer patient datasets with survival\nanalyzed by multivariable Cox models and adjusted for clinical prognostic\nfactors.\n  Findings: For age estimation, FAHR-FaceAge had the lowest mean absolute error\nof 5.1 years on public datasets, outperforming benchmark models and maintaining\naccuracy across the full human lifespan. In cancer patients, FAHR-FaceAge\noutperformed a prior facial age estimation model in survival prognostication.\nFAHR-FaceSurvival demonstrated robust prediction of mortality, and the\nhighest-risk quartile had more than triple the mortality of the lowest\n(adjusted hazard ratio 3.22; P<0.001). These findings were validated in the\nindependent cohort and both models showed generalizability across age, sex,\nrace and cancer subgroups. The two algorithms provided distinct, complementary\nprognostic information; saliency mapping revealed each model relied on distinct\nfacial regions. The combination of FAHR-FaceAge and FAHR-FaceSurvival improved\nprognostic accuracy.\n  Interpretation: A single foundation model can generate inexpensive, scalable\nfacial biomarkers that capture both biological ageing and disease-related\nmortality risk.

Although\nrecent advances in generative AI -- particularly large language models (LLMs)\n-- offer new opportunities to support mental health, little is known about how\ncaregivers perceive and engage with such technologies. To address this gap, we\ndeveloped Carey, a GPT-4o-based chatbot designed to provide informational and\nemotional support to AD/ADRD caregivers. Using Carey as a technology probe, we\nconducted semi-structured interviews with 16 family caregivers following\nscenario-driven interactions grounded in common caregiving stressors. Through\ninductive coding and reflexive thematic analysis, we surface a systemic\nunderstanding of caregiver needs and expectations across six themes --\non-demand information access, emotional support, safe space for disclosure,\ncrisis management, personalization, and data privacy. For each of these themes,\nwe also identified the nuanced tensions in the caregivers' desires and\nconcerns.

We conducted a comprehensive analysis using 36\nLLMs and found that, while LLMs generally understand the intent of\ninstructions, biases toward specific concept order patterns often lead to\nlow-diversity outputs or identical results even when the concept order is\naltered. Moreover, even the most instruction-compliant LLM achieved only about\n75% ordered coverage, highlighting the need for improvements in both\ninstruction-following and compositional generalization capabilities."}

Does higher perceptual quality of images already\ntranslate to better MLLM understanding? We conduct the first systematic study\nspanning leading MLLMs and a suite of vision-language benchmarks, applying\ncontrolled degradations and stylistic shifts to each image. Surprisingly, we\nuncover a visual-quality paradox: model, task, and even individual-instance\nperformance can improve when images deviate from human-perceived fidelity.\nOff-the-shelf restoration pipelines fail to reconcile these idiosyncratic\npreferences. To close the gap, we introduce Visual-Quality Test-Time Tuning\n(VQ-TTT)-a lightweight adaptation module that: (1) inserts a learnable,\nlow-rank kernel before the frozen vision encoder to modulate frequency content;\nand (2) fine-tunes only shallow vision-encoder layers via LoRA. VQ-TTT\ndynamically adjusts each input image in a single forward pass, aligning it with\ntask-specific model preferences. Across the evaluated MLLMs and all datasets,\nVQ-TTT lifts significant average accuracy, with no external models, cached\nfeatures, or extra training data. These findings redefine ``better'' visual\ninputs for MLLMs and highlight the need for adaptive, rather than universally\n``clean'', imagery, in the new era of AI being the main data customer."}

We present AutoRule, a fully automated method for\nextracting rules from preference feedback and formulating them into rule-based\nrewards. AutoRule extraction operates in three stages: it leverages a reasoning\nmodel to interpret user preferences, identifies candidate rules from the\nreasoning chain of these interpretations, and synthesizes them into a unified\nrule set. Leveraging the finalized rule set, we employ language-model verifiers\nto compute the fraction of rules satisfied by each output, using this metric as\nan auxiliary reward alongside the learned reward model during policy\noptimization. Training a Llama-3-8B model with AutoRule results in a 28.6\\%\nrelative improvement in length-controlled win rate on AlpacaEval2.0, and a\n6.1\\% relative gain in second-turn performance on a held-out MT-Bench subset,\ncompared to a GRPO baseline trained with the same learned reward model but\nwithout the rule-based auxiliary reward. Our analysis confirms that the\nextracted rules exhibit good agreement with dataset preference. We find that\nAutoRule demonstrates reduced reward hacking compared to a learned reward model\nwhen run over two episodes. Finally, our case study suggests that the extracted\nrules capture unique qualities valued in different datasets. The extracted\nrules are provided in the appendix, and the code is open-sourced at\nhttps://github.com/cxcscmu/AutoRule."}

Unlike final outputs, reasoning traces are often\nassumed to be internal and safe. We challenge this assumption by showing that\nreasoning traces frequently contain sensitive user data, which can be extracted\nvia prompt injections or accidentally leak into outputs. Through probing and\nagentic evaluations, we demonstrate that test-time compute approaches,\nparticularly increased reasoning steps, amplify such leakage. While increasing\nthe budget of those test-time compute approaches makes models more cautious in\ntheir final answers, it also leads them to reason more verbosely and leak more\nin their own thinking. This reveals a core tension: reasoning improves utility\nbut enlarges the privacy attack surface. We argue that safety efforts must\nextend to the model's internal thinking, not just its outputs."}

However, existing video\ngeneration datasets are not well-suited for world exploration training as they\nsuffer from some limitations: limited locations, short duration, static scenes,\nand a lack of annotations about exploration and the world. In this paper, we\nintroduce Sekai (meaning ``world'' in Japanese), a high-quality first-person\nview worldwide video dataset with rich annotations for world exploration. It\nconsists of over 5,000 hours of walking or drone view (FPV and UVA) videos from\nover 100 countries and regions across 750 cities. We develop an efficient and\neffective toolbox to collect, pre-process and annotate videos with location,\nscene, weather, crowd density, captions, and camera trajectories. Experiments\ndemonstrate the quality of the dataset. And, we use a subset to train an\ninteractive video world exploration model, named YUME (meaning ``dream'' in\nJapanese). We believe Sekai will benefit the area of video generation and world\nexploration, and motivate valuable applications."}

Ideally, training an\nSAE would yield latents that are both sparse and semantically meaningful.\nHowever, many SAE latents activate frequently (i.e., are \\emph{dense}), raising\nconcerns that they may be undesirable artifacts of the training procedure. In\nthis work, we systematically investigate the geometry, function, and origin of\ndense latents and show that they are not only persistent but often reflect\nmeaningful model representations. We first demonstrate that dense latents tend\nto form antipodal pairs that reconstruct specific directions in the residual\nstream, and that ablating their subspace suppresses the emergence of new dense\nfeatures in retrained SAEs -- suggesting that high density features are an\nintrinsic property of the residual space. We then introduce a taxonomy of dense\nlatents, identifying classes tied to position tracking, context binding,\nentropy regulation, letter-specific output signals, part-of-speech, and\nprincipal component reconstruction. Finally, we analyze how these features\nevolve across layers, revealing a shift from structural features in early\nlayers, to semantic features in mid layers, and finally to output-oriented\nsignals in the last layers of the model. Our findings indicate that dense\nlatents serve functional roles in language model computation and should not be\ndismissed as training noise."}
