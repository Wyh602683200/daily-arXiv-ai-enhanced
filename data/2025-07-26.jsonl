Motivated by the\nrecognition that, in fluid mechanics, an understanding of the underlying flow\nphysics is as crucial as accurate prediction, this study applies SR to model a\nfundamental three-dimensional (3D) incompressible flow in a rectangular\nchannel, focusing on the (axial) velocity and pressure fields under laminar\nconditions. By employing the PySR library, compact symbolic equations were\nderived directly from numerical simulation data, revealing key characteristics\nof the flow dynamics. These equations not only approximate the parabolic\nvelocity profile and pressure drop observed in the studied fluid flow, but also\nperfectly coincide with analytical solutions from the literature. Furthermore,\nwe propose an innovative approach that integrates SR with the\nknowledge-representation framework of Answer Set Programming (ASP), combining\nthe generative power of SR with the declarative reasoning strengths of ASP. The\nproposed hybrid SR/ASP framework ensures that the SR-generated symbolic\nexpressions are not only statistically accurate, but also physically plausible,\nadhering to domain-specific principles. Overall, the study highlights two key\ncontributions: SR's ability to simplify complex flow behaviours into concise,\ninterpretable equations, and the potential of knowledge-representation\napproaches to improve the reliability and alignment of data-driven SR models\nwith domain principles. Insights from the examined 3D channel flow pave the way\nfor integrating such hybrid approaches into efficient frameworks, [...] where\nexplainable predictions and real-time data analysis are crucial."}

This\nsensitivity to item positioning in a LLM's prompt is known as position bias.\nPrior research shows that this bias exists even in large models, though its\nseverity varies across models and tasks. In addition to position bias, LLMs\nalso exhibit varying degrees of low repetition consistency, where repeating the\nLLM call with the same candidate ordering can lead to different rankings. To\naddress both inconsistencies, a common approach is to prompt the model multiple\ntimes with different candidate orderings and aggregate the results via majority\nvoting. However, this repetition strategy, significantly increases\ncomputational costs. Extending prior findings, we observe that both the\ndirection -- favoring either the earlier or later candidate in the prompt --\nand magnitude of position bias across instances vary substantially, even within\na single dataset.

We present the first\nsystematic investigation of pathology FM robustness to non-biological features.\nOur work (i) introduces measures to quantify FM robustness, (ii) demonstrates\nthe consequences of limited robustness, and (iii) proposes a framework for FM\nrobustification to mitigate these issues. Specifically, we developed PathoROB,\na robustness benchmark with three novel metrics, including the robustness\nindex, and four datasets covering 28 biological classes from 34 medical\ncenters. Our experiments reveal robustness deficits across all 20 evaluated\nFMs, and substantial robustness differences between them. We found that\nnon-robust FM representations can cause major diagnostic downstream errors and\nclinical blunders that prevent safe clinical adoption. Using more robust FMs\nand post-hoc robustification considerably reduced (but did not yet eliminate)\nthe risk of such errors. This work establishes that robustness evaluation is\nessential for validating pathology FMs before clinical adoption and\ndemonstrates that future FM development must integrate robustness as a core\ndesign principle.

We identify key challenges rooted in Tigrinya's\nmorphological complexity and resource scarcity, while highlighting promising\nresearch directions, including morphology-aware modeling, cross-lingual\ntransfer, and community-centered resource development. This work serves as both\na comprehensive reference for researchers and a roadmap for advancing Tigrinya\nNLP. A curated metadata of the surveyed studies and resources is made publicly\navailable.\\footnote{Tigrinya NLP Anthology:\nhttps://github.com/fgaim/tigrinya-nlp-anthology."}

The novelty of\nViGText lies in its integration of detailed explanations with visual data, as\nit provides a more context-aware analysis than captions, which often lack\nspecificity and fail to reveal subtle inconsistencies. ViGText systematically\ndivides images into patches, constructs image and text graphs, and integrates\nthem for analysis using Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) to identify deepfakes.\nThrough the use of multi-level feature extraction across spatial and frequency\ndomains, ViGText captures details that enhance its robustness and accuracy to\ndetect sophisticated deepfakes.

Despite its\npractical significance, research on parameter-efficient representations of 3D\nconvolution operations remains limited. To bridge this gap, we propose Tensor\nVolumetric Operator (TenVOO), a novel PEFT method specifically designed for\nfine-tuning DDPMs with 3D convolutional backbones. Leveraging tensor network\nmodeling, TenVOO represents 3D convolution kernels with lower-dimensional\ntensors, effectively capturing complex spatial dependencies during fine-tuning\nwith few parameters. We evaluate TenVOO on three downstream brain MRI\ndatasets-ADNI, PPMI, and BraTS2021-by fine-tuning a DDPM pretrained on 59,830\nT1-weighted brain MRI scans from the UK Biobank. Our results demonstrate that\nTenVOO achieves state-of-the-art performance in multi-scale structural\nsimilarity index measure (MS-SSIM), outperforming existing approaches in\ncapturing spatial dependencies while requiring only 0.3% of the trainable\nparameters of the original model.

In this regard, current studies mainly concentrate on leveraging\nvarious translation knowledge into ST models. However, these methods often\nstruggle with interference from irrelevant noise and can not fully utilize the\ntranslation knowledge. To address these issues, in this paper, we propose a\nnovel Locate-and-Focus method for terminology translation. It first effectively\nlocates the speech clips containing terminologies within the utterance to\nconstruct translation knowledge, minimizing irrelevant information for the ST\nmodel. Subsequently, it associates the translation knowledge with the utterance\nand hypothesis from both audio and textual modalities, allowing the ST model to\nbetter focus on translation knowledge during translation. Experimental results\nacross various datasets demonstrate that our method effectively locates\nterminologies within utterances and enhances the success rate of terminology\ntranslation, while maintaining robust general translation performance."}

The dataset comprises 103K video samples (3K reserved for\ntesting), each paired with audio and systematically detailed textual\ndescriptions. Specifically, every video and its audio is described across three\nhierarchical layers (factual, abstract, and intent), progressing from surface\nto depth. It contains over 22 million words, averaging ~225 words per sample.\nVideoMind's key distinction from existing datasets is its provision of intent\nexpressions, which require contextual integration across the entire video and\nare not directly observable. These deep-cognitive expressions are generated\nusing a Chain-of-Thought (COT) approach, prompting the mLLM through\nstep-by-step reasoning. Each description includes annotations for subject,\nplace, time, event, action, and intent, supporting downstream recognition\ntasks. Crucially, we establish a gold-standard benchmark with 3,000 manually\nvalidated samples for evaluating deep-cognitive video understanding. We design\nhybrid-cognitive retrieval experiments, scored by multi-level retrieval\nmetrics, to appropriately assess deep video comprehension. Evaluation results\nfor models (e.g., InternVideo, VAST, UMT-L) are released. VideoMind serves as a\npowerful benchmark for fine-grained cross-modal alignment and advances fields\nrequiring in-depth video understanding, such as emotion and intent recognition.\nThe data is publicly available on GitHub, HuggingFace, and OpenDataLab,\nhttps://github.com/cdx-cindy/VideoMind."}
