As symbiosis grows, AI\nsystems pose greater ethical risks, including harm to human rights and trust.\nEthical Risk Assessment (ERA) thus becomes crucial for guiding decisions that\nminimize such risks. However, ERA is hindered by uncertainty, vagueness, and\nincomplete information, and morality itself is context-dependent and imprecise.\nThis motivates the need for a flexible, transparent, yet robust framework for\nERA. Our work supports ethical decision-making by quantitatively assessing and\nprioritizing multiple ethical risks so that artificial agents can select\nactions aligned with human values and acceptable risk levels. We introduce\nff4ERA, a fuzzy framework that integrates Fuzzy Logic, the Fuzzy Analytic\nHierarchy Process (FAHP), and Certainty Factors (CF) to quantify ethical risks\nvia an Ethical Risk Score (ERS) for each risk type. The final ERS combines the\nFAHP-derived weight, propagated CF, and risk level. The framework offers a\nrobust mathematical approach for collaborative ERA modeling and systematic,\nstep-by-step analysis. A case study confirms that ff4ERA yields\ncontext-sensitive, ethically meaningful risk scores reflecting both expert\ninput and sensor-based evidence. Risk scores vary consistently with relevant\nfactors while remaining robust to unrelated inputs. Local sensitivity analysis\nshows predictable, mostly monotonic behavior across perturbations, and global\nSobol analysis highlights the dominant influence of expert-defined weights and\ncertainty factors, validating the model design. Overall, the results\ndemonstrate ff4ERA ability to produce interpretable, traceable, and risk-aware\nethical assessments, enabling what-if analyses and guiding designers in\ncalibrating membership functions and expert judgments for reliable ethical\ndecision support."}

I report the first tests of\nKahneman and Tversky's landmark 'prospect theory' with Large Language Models,\nincluding today's state of the art chain-of-thought 'reasoners'.\n  In common with humans, I find that prospect theory often anticipates how\nthese models approach risky decisions across a range of scenarios.

The 'frame' through which risk is apprehended appears to be embedded\nwithin the language of the scenarios tackled by the models.

However, a significant scientific challenge is the lack of\nrigorous risk control and reliable uncertainty quantification in existing\ndiagnostic models, particularly when facing complex scenarios such as\ndistributional shifts. To address this issue, this paper proposes a novel fault\ndetection method that integrates significance testing with the conformal\nprediction framework to provide formal risk guarantees. The method transforms\nfault detection into a hypothesis testing task by defining a nonconformity\nmeasure based on model residuals. It then leverages a calibration dataset to\ncompute p-values for new samples, which are used to construct prediction sets\nmathematically guaranteed to contain the true label with a user-specified\nprobability, $1-\\alpha$. Fault classification is subsequently performed by\nanalyzing the intersection of the constructed prediction set with predefined\nnormal and fault label sets. Experimental results on cross-domain fault\ndiagnosis tasks validate the theoretical properties of our approach. The\nproposed method consistently achieves an empirical coverage rate at or above\nthe nominal level ($1-\\alpha$), demonstrating robustness even when the\nunderlying point-prediction models perform poorly. Furthermore, the results\nreveal a controllable trade-off between the user-defined risk level ($\\alpha$)\nand efficiency, where higher risk tolerance leads to smaller average prediction\nset sizes. This research contributes a theoretically grounded framework for\nfault detection that enables explicit risk control, enhancing the\ntrustworthiness of diagnostic systems in safety-critical applications and\nadvancing the field from simple point predictions to informative,\nuncertainty-aware outputs."}

Existing benchmarking and evaluation methods investigate planning with\nLLMs, focusing primarily on success rate as a quality indicator in various\nplanning tasks, such as validating plans or planning in relaxed conditions. In\nthis paper, we approach planning with LLMs as a natural language processing\n(NLP) task, given that LLMs are NLP models themselves. We propose a recovery\npipeline consisting of an NLP-based evaluation of the generated plans, along\nwith three stages to recover the plans through NLP manipulation of the\nLLM-generated plans, and eventually complete the plan using a symbolic planner.\nThis pipeline provides a holistic analysis of LLM capabilities in the context\nof AI task planning, enabling a broader understanding of the quality of invalid\nplans. Our findings reveal no clear evidence of underlying reasoning during\nplan generation, and that a pipeline comprising an NLP-based analysis of the\nplans, followed by a recovery mechanism, still falls short of the quality and\nreliability of classical planners.

However, since models are\ntrained on human-generated data, they may inherit cognitive biases that\nsystematically distort human judgment, including escalation of commitment,\nwhere decision-makers continue investing in failing courses of action due to\nprior investment. Understanding when LLMs exhibit such biases presents a unique\nchallenge. While these biases are well-documented in humans, it remains unclear\nwhether they manifest consistently in LLMs or require specific triggering\nconditions. This paper investigates this question using a two-stage investment\ntask across four experimental conditions: model as investor, model as advisor,\nmulti-agent deliberation, and compound pressure scenario. Across N = 6,500\ntrials, we find that bias manifestation in LLMs is highly context-dependent. In\nindividual decision-making contexts (Studies 1-2, N = 4,000), LLMs demonstrate\nstrong rational cost-benefit logic with minimal escalation of commitment.\nHowever, multi-agent deliberation reveals a striking hierarchy effect (Study 3,\nN = 500): while asymmetrical hierarchies show moderate escalation rates\n(46.2%), symmetrical peer-based decision-making produces near-universal\nescalation (99.2%). Similarly, when subjected to compound organizational and\npersonal pressures (Study 4, N = 2,000), models exhibit high degrees of\nescalation of commitment (68.95% average allocation to failing divisions).\nThese findings reveal that LLM bias manifestation depends critically on social\nand organizational context rather than being inherent, with significant\nimplications for the deployment of multi-agent systems and unsupervised\noperations where such conditions may emerge naturally."}

First, Traffic-R1 delivers zero-shot\ngeneralisation, transferring unchanged to new road networks and\nout-of-distribution incidents by utilizing its internal traffic control\npolicies and human-like reasoning. Second, its 3B-parameter architecture is\nlightweight enough for real-time inference on mobile-class chips, enabling\nlarge-scale edge deployment. Third, Traffic-R1 provides an explainable TSC\nprocess and facilitates multi-intersection communication through its\nself-iteration and a new synchronous communication network. Extensive\nbenchmarks demonstrate that Traffic-R1 sets a new state of the art,\noutperforming strong baselines and training-intensive RL controllers. In\npractice, the model now manages signals for more than 55,000 drivers daily,\nshortening average queues by over 5% and halving operator workload.

Engineering product design lies at the\nintersection of these difficult tasks, providing new challenges for AI\ncapabilities. Bike-Bench evaluates AI models' capability to generate designs\nthat not only resemble the dataset, but meet specific performance objectives\nand constraints. To do so, Bike-Bench quantifies a variety of human-centered\nand multiphysics performance characteristics, such as aerodynamics, ergonomics,\nstructural mechanics, human-rated usability, and similarity to subjective text\nor image prompts. Supporting the benchmark are several datasets of simulation\nresults, a dataset of 10K human-rated bicycle assessments, and a\nsynthetically-generated dataset of 1.4M designs, each with a parametric,\nCAD/XML, SVG, and PNG representation. Bike-Bench is uniquely configured to\nevaluate tabular generative models, LLMs, design optimization, and hybrid\nalgorithms side-by-side. Our experiments indicate that LLMs and tabular\ngenerative models fall short of optimization and optimization-augmented\ngenerative models in both validity and optimality scores, suggesting\nsignificant room for improvement.

For fast-moving objects such as aircraft, vehicles, or\ntrains, satellite connectivity is critical due to their mobility and frequent\npresence in areas without terrestrial coverage. Maintaining reliable\nconnectivity in these cases requires frequent switching between satellite\nbeams, constellations, or orbits. To enhance user experience and address\nchallenges like long switching times, Machine Learning (ML) algorithms can\nanalyze historical connectivity data and predict network quality at specific\nlocations.

Even mild post-processing applied to evaluation images can\nsignificantly degrade detector performance, raising concerns about their\nreliability in operational contexts. In this work, we show that the same deep\narchitecture can react very differently to unseen post-processing depending on\nthe learned weights, despite achieving similar accuracy on in-distribution test\ndata. This variability stems from differences in the latent spaces induced by\ntraining, which affect how samples are separated internally. Our experiments\nreveal a strong correlation between the distribution of latent margins and a\ndetector's ability to generalize to post-processed images. Based on this\nobservation, we propose a practical strategy for building more robust\ndetectors: train several variants of the same model under different conditions,\nand select the one that maximizes latent margins."}

While fusing multiple domains often\npresumes enhanced accuracy, this work demonstrates that adding modalities can\nyield diminishing returns, as not all fusions are inherently advantageous. To\nvalidate this, five deep learning models were designed, developed, and\nrigorously evaluated: three unimodal (1D-CNN for time, 2D-CNN for\ntime-frequency, and 1D-CNN-Transformer for frequency) and two multimodal\n(Hybrid 1, which fuses 1D-CNN and 2D-CNN; Hybrid 2, which combines 1D-CNN,\n2D-CNN, and a Transformer). For ECG classification, bootstrapping and Bayesian\ninference revealed that Hybrid 1 consistently outperformed the 2D-CNN baseline\nacross all metrics (p-values < 0.05, Bayesian probabilities > 0.90), confirming\nthe synergistic complementarity of the time and time-frequency domains.\nConversely, Hybrid 2's inclusion of the frequency domain offered no further\nimprovement and sometimes a marginal decline, indicating representational\nredundancy; a phenomenon further substantiated by a targeted ablation study.\nThis research redefines a fundamental principle of multimodal design in\nbiomedical signal analysis. We demonstrate that optimal domain fusion isn't\nabout the number of modalities, but the quality of their inherent\ncomplementarity. This paradigm-shifting concept moves beyond purely heuristic\nfeature selection. Our novel theoretical contribution, \"Complementary Feature\nDomains in Multimodal ECG Deep Learning,\" presents a mathematically\nquantifiable framework for identifying ideal domain combinations, demonstrating\nthat optimal multimodal performance arises from the intrinsic\ninformation-theoretic complementarity among fused domains."}

In contrast,\nlearning-based approaches are typically more robust to modeling errors but\nrequire large amounts of data. In this paper, we bridge these two approaches to\npropose a framework for learning closed-loop pivoting manipulation.

To address this issue, this paper proposes a Full-stage\nRefined Proposal (FRP) algorithm aimed at eliminating these false positives\nwithin a two-stage CNN-based pedestrian detection framework. The main\ninnovation of this work lies in employing various pedestrian feature\nre-evaluation strategies to filter out low-quality pedestrian proposals during\nboth the training and testing stages. Specifically, in the training phase, the\nTraining mode FRP algorithm (TFRP) introduces a novel approach for validating\npedestrian proposals to effectively guide the model training process, thereby\nconstructing a model with strong capabilities for false positive suppression.\nDuring the inference phase, two innovative strategies are implemented: the\nClassifier-guided FRP (CFRP) algorithm integrates a pedestrian classifier into\nthe proposal generation pipeline to yield high-quality proposals through\npedestrian feature evaluation, and the Split-proposal FRP (SFRP) algorithm\nvertically divides all proposals, sending both the original and the sub-region\nproposals to the subsequent subnetwork to evaluate their confidence scores,\nfiltering out those with lower sub-region pedestrian confidence scores.

To formalize this, we propose\nWeb-CogKnowledge Framework, categorizing knowledge as Factual, Conceptual, and\nProcedural. In this framework, knowledge content learning corresponds to the\nagent's processes of Memorizing and Understanding, which rely on the first two\nknowledge types, representing the \"what\" of learning. Conversely, cognitive\nprocesses correspond to Exploring, grounded in Procedural knowledge, defining\nthe \"how\" of reasoning and action.

Its compact adapter matrices also quantize\nto 8- or 4-bit with less accuracy degradation than LoRA, enabling further\nmemory and storage savings for on-device deployment. We benchmark on DistilBERT\nand Mistral-7B across five tasks (PIQA, HellaSwag, WinoGrande, ARC-Easy,\nARC-Challenge) over multiple epochs of adapter-only tuning: on DistilBERT, an\n840 K-parameter Kron-LoRA matches LoRA-16's performance, and on Mistral-7B, a\n5.7 M-parameter Kron-LoRA rivals LoRA-8 with modest memory savings and only a\n3-8\\% speed overhead. In sequential fine-tuning from ARC-Challenge to ARC-Easy,\nKron-LoRA retains 55.18\\% accuracy versus 53.17\\% for LoRA-8-despite using only\none-quarter of the adapter parameters-underscoring its competitive cross-task\ntransfer performance. By uniting Kronecker structure, low-rank compression,\nquantization-friendliness, and by providing transparent trade-off analysis,\nKron-LoRA offers a scalable, sustainable, and continual-learning-ready solution\nfor multi-task adaptation of large language models."}

To bridge this gap, we conduct a systematic\nempirical analysis of the entropy-performance exchange mechanism of RLVR across\ndifferent levels of granularity.

Specifically, FAIR-Pruner first evaluates\nthe importance of each unit (e.g., neuron or channel) through the Utilization\nScore quantified by the Wasserstein distance.

By exploring this, this paper introduces the\nforgetting curve and proposes Spatio-Temporal periodic Interest Modeling (STIM)\nwith long sequences for local-life service recommendation. STIM integrates\nthree key components: a dynamic masking module based on the forgetting curve,\nwhich is used to extract both recent spatiotemporal features and periodic\nspatiotemporal features; a query-based mixture of experts (MoE) approach that\ncan adaptively activate expert networks under different dynamic masks, enabling\nthe collaborative modeling of time, location, and items; and a hierarchical\nmulti-interest network unit, which captures multi-interest representations by\nmodeling the hierarchical interactions between the shallow and deep semantics\nof users' recent behaviors.

This hybrid dual feedback mechanism enables self-correcting\nprogram synthesis with minimal human supervision. Our results demonstrate that\nHyCodePolicy significantly improves the robustness and sample efficiency of\nrobot manipulation policies, offering a scalable strategy for integrating\nmultimodal reasoning into autonomous decision-making pipelines."}

This paper introduces a novel\ncontinuous-time mixed-integer linear programming (MILP) model to solve this\nintegrated spatio-temporal problem. By treating time as a continuous variable,\nour formulation overcomes the scalability limitations of traditional\ndiscrete-time approaches. The performance of the exact model is benchmarked\nagainst a constructive heuristic, and its practical applicability is\ndemonstrated through a custom-built visualization dashboard. Computational\nresults are compelling: the model solves instances with up to 25 aircraft to\nproven optimality, often in mere seconds, and for large-scale cases of up to 40\naircraft, delivers high-quality solutions within known optimality gaps. In all\ntested scenarios, the resulting solutions consistently and significantly\noutperform the heuristic, which highlights the framework's substantial economic\nbenefits and provides valuable managerial insights into the trade-off between\nsolution time and optimality."}
