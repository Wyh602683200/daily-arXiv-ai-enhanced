We propose a novel single-agent reinforcement learning\n(RL) framework for bus holding control that avoids the data imbalance and\nconvergence issues of MARL under near-realistic simulation. A bidirectional\ntimetabled network with dynamic passenger demand is constructed. The key\ninnovation is reformulating the multi-agent problem into a single-agent one by\naugmenting the state space with categorical identifiers (vehicle ID, station\nID, time period) in addition to numerical features (headway, occupancy,\nvelocity). This high-dimensional encoding enables single-agent policies to\ncapture inter-agent dependencies, analogous to projecting non-separable inputs\ninto a higher-dimensional space. We further design a structured reward function\naligned with operational goals: instead of exponential penalties on headway\ndeviations, a ridge-shaped reward balances uniform headways and schedule\nadherence. Experiments show that our modified soft actor-critic (SAC) achieves\nmore stable and superior performance than benchmarks, including MADDPG (e.g.,\n-430k vs. -530k under stochastic conditions). These results demonstrate that\nsingle-agent deep RL, when enhanced with categorical structuring and\nschedule-aware rewards, can effectively manage bus holding in non-loop,\nreal-world contexts. This paradigm offers a robust, scalable alternative to\nMARL frameworks, particularly where agent-specific experiences are imbalanced."}

However, the high computational cost of\nGibbs sampling in content generation tasks imposes significant bottlenecks on\nelectronic implementations. Here, we propose a photonic restricted Boltzmann\nmachine (PRBM) that leverages photonic computing to accelerate Gibbs sampling,\nenabling efficient content generation. By introducing an efficient encoding\nmethod, the PRBM eliminates the need for computationally intensive matrix\ndecomposition and reduces the computational complexity of Gibbs sampling from\n$O(N)$ to $O(1)$. Moreover, its non-Von Neumann photonic computing architecture\ncircumvents the memory storage of interaction matrices, providing substantial\nadvantages for large-scale RBMs. We experimentally validate the\nphotonic-accelerated Gibbs sampling by simulating a two-dimensional Ising\nmodel, where the observed phase transition temperature closely matches the\ntheoretical predictions. Beyond physics-inspired tasks, the PRBM demonstrates\nrobust capabilities in generating and restoring diverse content, including\nimages and temporal sequences, even in the presence of noise and aberrations.\nThe scalability and reduced training cost of the PRBM framework underscore its\npotential as a promising pathway for advancing photonic computing in generative\nartificial intelligence."}

Our user studies demonstrate that FakeParts reduces human\ndetection accuracy by over 30% compared to traditional deepfakes, with similar\nperformance degradation observed in state-of-the-art detection models. This\nwork identifies an urgent vulnerability in current deepfake detection\napproaches and provides the necessary resources to develop more robust methods\nfor partial video manipulations."}

However, scaling diffusion transformers to generate long-context\nvideos is fundamentally limited by the quadratic cost of self-attention, which\nmakes memory and computation intractable and difficult to optimize for long\nsequences. We recast long-context video generation as an internal information\nretrieval task and propose a simple, learnable sparse attention routing module,\nMixture of Contexts (MoC), as an effective long-term memory retrieval engine.\nIn MoC, each query dynamically selects a few informative chunks plus mandatory\nanchors (caption, local windows) to attend to, with causal routing that\nprevents loop closures. As we scale the data and gradually sparsify the\nrouting, the model allocates compute to salient history, preserving identities,\nactions, and scenes over minutes of content. Efficiency follows as a byproduct\nof retrieval (near-linear scaling), which enables practical training and\nsynthesis, and the emergence of memory and consistency at the scale of minutes."}

For a demo\n  video, see https://youtu.be/uobhmxo6EIE", "summary": "As multi-turn dialogues with large language models (LLMs) grow longer and\nmore complex, how can users better evaluate and review progress on their\nconversational goals? We present OnGoal, an LLM chat interface that helps users\nbetter manage goal progress. OnGoal provides real-time feedback on goal\nalignment through LLM-assisted evaluation, explanations for evaluation results\nwith examples, and overviews of goal progression over time, enabling users to\nnavigate complex dialogues more effectively. Through a study with 20\nparticipants on a writing task, we evaluate OnGoal against a baseline chat\ninterface without goal tracking. Using OnGoal, participants spent less time and\neffort to achieve their goals while exploring new prompting strategies to\novercome miscommunication, suggesting tracking and visualizing goals can\nenhance engagement and resilience in LLM dialogues. Our findings inspired\ndesign implications for future LLM chat interfaces that improve goal\ncommunication, reduce cognitive load, enhance interactivity, and enable\nfeedback to improve LLM performance."}

This\npaper introduces Prompt-to-Product, an automated pipeline that generates\nreal-world assembly products from natural language prompts. Specifically, we\nleverage LEGO bricks as the assembly platform and automate the process of\ncreating brick assembly structures. Given the user design requirements,\nPrompt-to-Product generates physically buildable brick designs, and then\nleverages a bimanual robotic system to construct the real assembly products,\nbringing user imaginations into the real world. We conduct a comprehensive user\nstudy, and the results demonstrate that Prompt-to-Product significantly lowers\nthe barrier and reduces manual effort in creating assembly products from\nimaginative ideas."}
