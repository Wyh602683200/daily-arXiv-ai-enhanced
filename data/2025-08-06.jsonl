This work presents the\nfirst systematic study of the efficiency-effectiveness trade-off in modern\nagent systems, addressing the critical need for cost-effective designs without\nsacrificing performance. We investigate three key questions: (1) How much\ncomplexity do agentic tasks inherently require? (2) When do additional modules\nyield diminishing returns? (3) How much efficiency can be gained through the\ndesign of efficient agent frameworks? Through an empirical analysis on the GAIA\nbenchmark, we evaluate the impact of LLM backbone selection, agent framework\ndesigns, and test-time scaling strategies. Using the cost-of-pass metric, we\nquantify the efficiency-performance trade-off across these dimensions. Our\nfindings inform the development of Efficient Agents , a novel agent framework\nthat has an optimal complexity to task requirements. Efficient Agents retains\n96.7% of the performance of OWL, one leading open-source agent framework, while\nreducing operational costs from $0.398 to $0.228, resulting in a 28.4%\nimprovement in cost-of-pass.

To analyze their potential, the following best-in-class\ndomain-agnostic models are introduced: Logic Neural Network (LNN), which uses\nthe integrative approach, and LLM-Symbolic Solver (LLM-SS), which uses the\nhybrid approach. Using both models as case studies and representatives of each\napproach, our analysis demonstrates that the hybrid approach is more promising\nfor developing general logical reasoning because (i) its reasoning chain is\nmore interpretable, and (ii) it retains the capabilities and advantages of\nexisting LLMs. To support future works using the hybrid approach, we propose a\ngeneralizable framework based on LLM-SS that is modular by design,\nmodel-agnostic, domain-agnostic, and requires little to no human input."}

To bridge this gap, we propose a novel step-by-step code\ngeneration framework named UML2Dep by leveraging unambiguous formal\nspecifications of complex requirements. First, we introduce an enhanced Unified\nModeling Language (UML) sequence diagram tailored for service-oriented\narchitectures.

Second, recognizing the critical role of data\nflow, we introduce a dedicated data dependency inference (DDI) task. DDI\nsystematically constructs an explicit data dependency graph prior to actual\ncode synthesis. To ensure reliability, we formalize DDI as a constrained\nmathematical reasoning task through novel prompting strategies, aligning with\nLLMs' excellent mathematical strengths.

Drawing on insights from nominalist philosophy and oversight\ntheoretic limits in AI, we argue that the observer paradox in quantum mechanics\nreflects not an ontological lacuna, but a linguistic one: the absence of a\nformal vocabulary for modeling first person structure. QAL introduces such a\nvocabulary, providing a morphodynamic framework that embeds the observer within\nthe system and replaces abstract projection with endogenous transformation. We\nanalyze the alignment of QAL with endophysical approaches, contrast it with\nstandard interpretations of quantum theory, and explore its implications for a\npost Platonist, introspectively grounded physics."}

Consider the\ndifferent interaction types of single and multiple models, we design three\nprimary paradigms to investigate the optimal paradigm of CTTS: (1) single agent\nto multiple reward models (SA-MR); (2) multiple agents to single reward model\n(MA-SR); and (3) multiple agents to multiple reward models (MA-MR). Extensive\nexperiments demonstrate that MA-MR consistently achieves the best performance.\nBased on this, we propose a novel framework named CTTS-MM that effectively\nleverages both multi-agent and multi-reward-model collaboration for enhanced\ninference. Specifically, for multi-agent collaboration, we propose an Agent\nCollaboration Search (ACS), which searches for the most effective combination\nof LLM agents from a large candidate pool; for multi-reward-model\ncollaboration, we propose Mixture of Reword Models (MoR), which consists of a\ncurated question pool and a Prior Reward model Ensemble Selection (PRES) to\nselect the optimal combinations of reward models via Pair-wise Reward Ranking\n(PRR) metric. Experiments across seven mainstream benchmarks demonstrate that\nthe proposed CTTS-MM consistently obtains superior performance. Code will be\nreleased at https://github.com/magent4aci/CTTS-MM."}

We hypothesize that a pre-trained language\nmodel can improve its reasoning skills given only a single prompt specifying\nthe topic (e.g., algebra word problems) and asking the model to generate its\nown questions. To do this, we propose Self-Questioning Language Models (SQLM):\nan asymmetric self-play framework where a proposer is given the topic and\ngenerates a question for a solver, who tries to answer it. Both the proposer\nand solver are trained via reinforcement learning. The proposer receives a\nreward if the problem is not too easy or too difficult, and the solver receives\na reward based on majority voting, a proxy for correctness in the absence of\nground-truth answers. For coding, the proposer can instead generate unit tests\nwhich are used for verification. We study this asymmetric self-play framework\non three benchmarks: three-digit multiplication, algebra problems from the\nOMEGA benchmark, and programming problems from Codeforces. By continually\ngenerating more interesting problems and attempting to solve them, language\nmodels can improve on downstream benchmarks without access to any curated\ntraining datasets."}

Most evaluation\nframeworks rely on regularized matching or employ general LLMs for answer\nverification, which demands extensive, repetitive customization for regex rules\nor evaluation prompts. Two fundamental limitations persist in current\nmethodologies: 1) the absence of comprehensive benchmarks that systematically\nevaluate verification capabilities across different LLMs; and 2) the nascent\nstage of verifier development, where existing approaches lack both the\nrobustness to handle complex edge cases and the generalizability across\ndifferent domains. In this work, we develop CompassVerifier, an accurate and\nrobust lightweight verifier model for evaluation and outcome reward. It\ndemonstrates multi-domain competency spanning math, knowledge, and diverse\nreasoning tasks, with the capability to process various answer types, including\nmulti-subproblems, formulas, and sequence answers, while effectively\nidentifying abnormal/invalid responses. We introduce VerifierBench benchmark\ncomprising model outputs collected from multiple data sources, augmented\nthrough manual analysis of metaerror patterns to enhance CompassVerifier. We\nanticipate that CompassVerifier and VerifierBench will facilitate answer\nverification, evaluation protocols, and reinforcement learning research. Code\nand dataset are available at https://github.com/open-compass/CompassVerifier."}
