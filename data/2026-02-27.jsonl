Submitted to [RAAI]", "summary": "Large Language Models (LLMs) demonstrate potential in the field of scientific idea generation. However, the generated results often lack controllable academic context and traceable inspiration pathways. To bridge this gap, this paper proposes a scientific idea generation system called GYWI, which combines author knowledge graphs with retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) to form an external knowledge base to provide controllable context and trace of inspiration path for LLMs to generate new scientific ideas. We first propose an author-centered knowledge graph construction method and inspiration source sampling algorithms to construct external knowledge base. Then, we propose a hybrid retrieval mechanism that is composed of both RAG and GraphRAG to retrieve content with both depth and breadth knowledge. It forms a hybrid context. Thirdly, we propose a Prompt optimization strategy incorporating reinforcement learning principles to automatically guide LLMs optimizing the results based on the hybrid context. To evaluate the proposed approaches, we constructed an evaluation dataset based on arXiv (2018-2023). This paper also develops a comprehensive evaluation method including empirical automatic assessment in multiple-choice question task, LLM-based scoring, human evaluation, and semantic space visualization analysis. The generated ideas are evaluated from the following five dimensions: novelty, feasibility, clarity, relevance, and significance. We conducted experiments on different LLMs including GPT-4o, DeepSeek-V3, Qwen3-8B, and Gemini 2.5. Experimental results show that GYWI significantly outperforms mainstream LLMs in multiple metrics such as novelty, reliability, and relevance."}

In addition, to assess the practical value of LLMs in real-world financial tasks, we propose a systematic evaluation matrix that categorizes complex financial domains and ensures coverage of essential subdomains and business activities. Based on this evaluation matrix, we collect 3,000 financial scenario questions, consisting of closed-form decision questions with reference answers and open-ended questions evaluated by predefined rubrics. We conduct comprehensive evaluations of state-of-the-art LLMs on the FIRE benchmark, including XuanYuan 4.0, our latest financial-domain model, as a strong in-domain baseline.

AI agents, by contrast, operate on prompts and natural language instructions with no formal behavioral specification. This gap is the root cause of drift, governance failures, and frequent project failures in agentic AI deployments. We introduce Agent Behavioral Contracts (ABC), a formal framework that brings Design-by-Contract principles to autonomous AI agents. An ABC contract C = (P, I, G, R) specifies Preconditions, Invariants, Governance policies, and Recovery mechanisms as first-class, runtime-enforceable components. We define (p, delta, k)-satisfaction -- a probabilistic notion of contract compliance that accounts for LLM non-determinism and recovery -- and prove a Drift Bounds Theorem showing that contracts with recovery rate gamma > alpha (the natural drift rate) bound behavioral drift to D* = alpha/gamma in expectation, with Gaussian concentration in the stochastic setting. We establish sufficient conditions for safe contract composition in multi-agent chains and derive probabilistic degradation bounds. We implement ABC in AgentAssert, a runtime enforcement library, and evaluate on AgentContract-Bench, a benchmark of 200 scenarios across 7 models from 6 vendors. Results across 1,980 sessions show that contracted agents detect 5.2-6.8 soft violations per session that uncontracted baselines miss entirely (p < 0.0001, Cohen's d = 6.7-33.8), achieve 88-100% hard constraint compliance, and bound behavioral drift to D* < 0.27 across extended sessions, with 100% recovery for frontier models and 17-100% across all models, at overhead < 10 ms per action."}

Unlike chatbots that respond to isolated queries, AI agents can now read files, run code, query databases, search the web, and invoke domain-specific skills to execute entire research pipelines autonomously. This paper introduces the concept of vibe researching -- the AI-era parallel to ``vibe coding'' (Karpathy, 2025) -- and uses scholar-skill, a 21-skill plugin for Claude Code covering the full research pipeline from idea to submission, as an illustrative case. I develop a cognitive task framework that classifies research activities along two dimensions -- codifiability and tacit knowledge requirement -- to identify a delegation boundary that is cognitive, not sequential: it cuts through every stage of the research pipeline, not between stages. I argue that AI agents excel at speed, coverage, and methodological scaffolding but struggle with theoretical originality and tacit field knowledge. The paper concludes with an analysis of three implications for the profession -- augmentation with fragile conditions, stratification risk, and a pedagogical crisis -- and proposes five principles for responsible vibe researching."}

We propose autonomous memory agents that actively acquire, validate, and curate knowledge at a minimum cost. U-Mem materializes this idea via (i) a cost-aware knowledge-extraction cascade that escalates from cheap self/teacher signals to tool-verified research and, only when needed, expert feedback, and (ii) semantic-aware Thompson sampling to balance exploration and exploitation over memories and mitigate cold-start bias. On both verifiable and non-verifiable benchmarks, U-Mem consistently beats prior memory baselines and can surpass RL-based optimization, improving HotpotQA (Qwen2.5-7B) by 14.6 points and AIME25 (Gemini-2.5-flash) by 7.33 points."}

To investigate the cognitive strategies underlying this ability, we introduce the Cognitive Abstraction and Reasoning Corpus (CogARC), a diverse human-adapted subset of the Abstraction and Reasoning Corpus (ARC) which was originally developed to benchmark abstract reasoning in artificial intelligence. Across two experiments, CogARC was administered to a total of 260 human participants who freely generated solutions to 75 abstract visual reasoning problems. Success required inferring input-output rules from a small number of examples to transform the test input into one correct test output. Participants' behavior was recorded at high temporal resolution, including example viewing, edit sequences, and multi-attempt submissions. Participants were generally successful (mean accuracy ~90% for experiment 1 (n=40), ~80% for experiment 2 (n=220) across problems), but performance varied widely across problems and participants. Harder problems elicited longer deliberation times and greater divergence in solution strategies. Over the course of the task, participants initiated responses more quickly but showed a slight decline in accuracy, suggesting increased familiarity with the task structure rather than improved rule-learning ability. Importantly, even incorrect solutions were often highly convergent, even when the problem-solving trajectories differed in length and smoothness. Some trajectories progressed directly and efficiently toward a stable outcome, whereas others involved extended exploration or partial restarts before converging. Together, these findings highlight CogARC as a rich behavioral environment for studying human abstract reasoning, providing insight into how people generalize, misgeneralize, and adapt their strategies under uncertainty."}

We propose a probabilistic framework where agents engage in a \\textit{calibration} phase, updating beliefs about their own fixed competence, before facing a final confidence gate that determines whether to vote or abstain. We derive a non-asymptotic lower bound on the group's success probability and prove that this \\textit{selective participation} generalizes the asymptotic guarantees of the CJT to a sequential, confidence-gated setting. Empirically, we validate these bounds via Monte Carlo simulations.

Recently, agentic generative AI systems have demonstrated significant advances in algorithm design, improving code efficiency, and enabling discovery across scientific domains.\n  Bridging these worlds, we present ArchAgent, an automated computer architecture discovery system built on AlphaEvolve. We show ArchAgent's ability to automatically design/implement state-of-the-art (SoTA) cache replacement policies (architecting new mechanisms/logic, not only changing parameters), broadly within the confines of an established cache replacement policy design competition.\n  In two days without human intervention, ArchAgent generated a policy achieving a 5.3% IPC speedup improvement over the prior SoTA on public multi-core Google Workload Traces. On the heavily-explored single-core SPEC06 workloads, it generated a policy in just 18 days showing a 0.9% IPC speedup improvement over the existing SoTA (a similar \"winning margin\" as reported by the existing SoTA). ArchAgent achieved these gains 3-5x faster than prior human-developed SoTA policies.\n  Agentic flows also enable \"post-silicon hyperspecialization\" where agents tune runtime-configurable parameters exposed in hardware policies to further align the policies with a specific workload (mix). Exploiting this, we demonstrate a 2.4% IPC speedup improvement over prior SoTA on SPEC06 workloads.\n  Finally, we outline broader implications for computer architecture research in the era of agentic AI. For example, we demonstrate the phenomenon of \"simulator escapes\", where the agentic AI flow discovered and exploited a loophole in a popular microarchitectural simulator - a consequence of the fact that these research tools were designed for a (now past) world where they were exclusively operated by humans acting in good-faith."}

This paradigm enables reasoning beyond discrete language tokens by performing multi-step computation in continuous latent spaces. Although there have been numerous studies focusing on improving the performance of latent reasoning, its internal mechanisms remain not fully investigated. In this work, we conduct a comprehensive analysis of latent reasoning methods to better understand the role and behavior of latent representation in the process. We identify two key issues across latent reasoning methods with different levels of supervision. First, we observe pervasive shortcut behavior, where they achieve high accuracy without relying on latent reasoning. Second, we examine the hypothesis that latent reasoning supports BFS-like exploration in latent space, and find that while latent representations can encode multiple possibilities, the reasoning process does not faithfully implement structured search, but instead exhibits implicit pruning and compression. Finally, our findings reveal a trade-off associated with supervision strength: stronger supervision mitigates shortcut behavior but restricts the ability of latent representations to maintain diverse hypotheses, whereas weaker supervision allows richer latent representations at the cost of increased shortcut behavior."}

However, existing evaluation practices remain outcome-centric, focusing primarily on final task performance. Through a review of prior work, we find that none of the surveyed agentic AutoML systems report structured, decision-level evaluation metrics intended for post-hoc assessment of intermediate decision quality. To address this limitation, we propose an Evaluation Agent (EA) that performs decision-centric assessment of AutoML agents without interfering with their execution. The EA is designed as an observer that evaluates intermediate decisions along four dimensions: decision validity, reasoning consistency, model quality risks beyond accuracy, and counterfactual decision impact. Across four proof-of-concept experiments, we demonstrate that the EA can (i) detect faulty decisions with an F1 score of 0.919, (ii) identify reasoning inconsistencies independent of final outcomes, and (iii) attribute downstream performance changes to agent decisions, revealing impacts ranging from -4.9\\% to +8.3\\% in final metrics. These results illustrate how decision-centric evaluation exposes failure modes that are invisible to outcome-only metrics. Our work reframes the evaluation of agentic AutoML systems from an outcome-based perspective to one that audits agent decisions, offering a foundation for reliable, interpretable, and governable autonomous ML systems."}

Existing approaches use supervised fine-tuning (SFT) to train action scorers, but SFT treats each candidate independently and does not explicitly teach the model to discriminate between actions that are physically correct and those that are subtly wrong. We propose the Contrastive World Model (CWM), which fine-tunes a large language model (LLM) as an action scorer using an InfoNCE contrastive objective with hard-mined negative examples. The key idea is to push valid actions away from invalid ones in scoring space, with special emphasis on hard negatives: semantically similar but physically incompatible candidates. We evaluate CWM on the ScienceWorld benchmark through two studies. First, an intrinsic affordance evaluation on 605 hard-negative test pairs shows that CWM outperforms SFT by +6.76 percentage points on Precision@1 for minimal-edit negatives -- cases where a single word changes the physical outcome -- and achieves a higher AUC-ROC (0.929 vs. 0.906). Second, a live filter characterisation study measures how well CWM ranks gold-path actions against all valid environment actions during task execution. Under out-of-distribution stress conditions, CWM maintains a significantly better safety margin (-2.39) than SFT (-3.96), indicating that the gold action is ranked closer to the top. These results support the hypothesis that contrastive training induces representations that capture physical feasibility more faithfully than SFT alone."}

Existing benchmarks evaluate whether LLMs can formulate optimization problems as solver code, but leave open a complementary question. Can LLMs directly produce correct solutions to fully specified constrained optimization problems without access to a solver? We introduce ConstraintBench, a benchmark for evaluating LLMs on direct constrained optimization across 10 operations research domains, with all ground-truth solutions verified by the Gurobi solver. Each task presents a natural-language scenario with entities, constraints, and an optimization objective; the model must return a structured solution that a deterministic verifier checks against every constraint and the solver-proven optimum. We evaluate six frontier models on 200 tasks and find that feasibility, not optimality, is the primary bottleneck. The best model achieves only 65.0% constraint satisfaction, yet feasible solutions average 89 to 96% of the Gurobi-optimal objective. No model exceeds 30.5% on joint feasibility and optimality within 0.1% of the solver reference. Per-domain analysis shows large variation in difficulty, with average feasibility spanning from 83.3% in the production mix domain to 0.8% in the crew assignment domain. Further, systematic failure modes include duration constraint misunderstanding, entity hallucination, and a feasibility-optimality decoupling in facility location and vehicle routing where models achieve high feasibility but 0% optimality.

To address these challenges, we introduce VERO (Versioning, Rewards, and Observations), which provides (1) a reproducible evaluation harness with versioned agent snapshots, budget-controlled evaluation, and structured execution traces, and (2) a benchmark suite of target agents and tasks with reference evaluation procedures. Using VERO, we conduct an empirical study comparing optimizer configurations across tasks and analyzing which modifications reliably improve target agent performance.

Our analyses reveal that as LCA research continues to expand, the adoption of AI technologies has grown dramatically, with a noticeable shift toward LLM-driven approaches, continued increases in ML applications, and statistically significant correlations between AI approaches and corresponding LCA stages. By integrating LLM-based text-mining methods with traditional literature review techniques, this study introduces a dynamic and effective framework capable of capturing both high-level research trends and nuanced conceptual patterns (themes) across the field.

Motivated by this observation, we propose Metacognitive Behavioral Tuning (MBT), a post-training framework that explicitly injects metacognitive behaviors into the model's thought process. MBT implements this via two complementary formulations: (1) MBT-S, which synthesizes rigorous reasoning traces from scratch, and (2) MBT-R, which rewrites the student's initial traces to stabilize intrinsic exploration patterns. Experiments across multi-hop QA benchmarks demonstrate that MBT consistently outperforms baselines, achieving notable gains on challenging benchmarks. By effectively eliminating reasoning collapse, MBT achieves higher accuracy with significantly reduced token consumption, demonstrating that internalizing metacognitive strategies leads to more stable and robust reasoning."}

Current AI systems process vast information to produce sophisticated predictions, yet predictions can appear successful while the underlying interaction with the environment degrades. What is missing is a principled measure of how much of the total information a system deploys is actually shared between its observations, actions, and outcomes. We prove this shared fraction, which we term bipredictability, P, is intrinsic to any interaction, derivable from first principles, and strictly bounded: P can reach unity in quantum systems, P equal to, or smaller than 0.5 in classical systems, and lower once agency (action selection) is introduced. We confirm these bounds in a physical system (double pendulum), reinforcement learning agents, and multi turn LLM conversations. These results distinguish agency from intelligence: agency is the capacity to act on predictions, whereas intelligence additionally requires learning from interaction, self-monitoring of its learning effectiveness, and adapting the scope of observations, actions, and outcomes to restore effective learning. By this definition, current AI systems achieve agency but not intelligence. Inspired by thalamocortical regulation in biological systems, we demonstrate a feedback architecture that monitors P in real time, establishing a prerequisite for adaptive, resilient AI."}

To make this point clear, we formalize the idea of an agent template that specifies roles for individual LLMs and how their functionalities should be composed. We then survey a variety of existing language agents in the literature and highlight their underlying templates derived directly from cognitive models or AI algorithms. By highlighting these designs, we aim to call attention to agent templates inspired by cognitive science and AI as a powerful tool for developing effective, interpretable language agents."}

The open RAN (O-RAN) architecture enables the deployment and coordination of such agents. However, most existing works consider simple intents handled by independent agents, while complex intents that require coordination among agents remain unexplored. In this paper, we propose an agentic AI framework for intent translation and optimization in cell-free O-RAN. A supervisor agent translates the operator intents into an optimization objective and minimum rate requirements. Based on this information, a user weighting agent retrieves relevant prior experience from a memory module to determine the user priority weights for precoding. If the intent includes an energy-saving objective, then an open radio unit (O-RU) management agent will also be activated to determine the set of active O-RUs by using a deep reinforcement learning (DRL) algorithm. A monitoring agent measures and monitors the user data rates and coordinates with other agents to guarantee the minimum rate requirements are satisfied. To enhance scalability, we adopt a parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) method that enables the same underlying LLM to be used for different agents. Simulation results show that the proposed agentic AI framework reduces the number of active O-RUs by 41.93% when compared with three baseline schemes in energy-saving mode. Using the PEFT method, the proposed framework reduces the memory usage by 92% when compared with deploying separate LLM agents."}

Extensive experiments in Minecraft demonstrate the framework's effectiveness, increasing task success rates by 32% on normal difficulty tasks and nearly 70% on highly difficult tasks, all with minimal human intervention. Our work demonstrates that successfully augmenting agents requires learning how to request expert reasoning, moving beyond simple requests for help."}

To address this, we introduce CourtGuard, a retrieval-augmented multi-agent framework that reimagines safety evaluation as Evidentiary Debate. By orchestrating an adversarial debate grounded in external policy documents, CourtGuard achieves state-of-the-art performance across 7 safety benchmarks, outperforming dedicated policy-following baselines without fine-tuning. Beyond standard metrics, we highlight two critical capabilities: (1) Zero-Shot Adaptability, where our framework successfully generalized to an out-of-domain Wikipedia Vandalism task (achieving 90\\% accuracy) by swapping the reference policy; and (2) Automated Data Curation and Auditing, where we leveraged CourtGuard to curate and audit nine novel datasets of sophisticated adversarial attacks. Our results demonstrate that decoupling safety logic from model weights offers a robust, interpretable, and adaptable path for meeting current and future regulatory requirements in AI governance."}

We show that this instability arises from a previously underexplored gap between strategy usage-whether a reasoning strategy appears in successful solutions-and strategy executability-whether the strategy remains effective when instantiated as guidance for a target model. Through a controlled analysis of paired human-written and model-generated solutions, we identify a systematic dissociation between usage and executability: human- and model-derived strategies differ in structured, domain-dependent ways, leading to complementary strengths and consistent source-dependent reversals under guidance. Building on this diagnosis, we propose Selective Strategy Retrieval (SSR), a test-time framework that explicitly models executability by selectively retrieving and combining strategies using empirical, multi-route, source-aware signals. Across multiple mathematical reasoning benchmarks, SSR yields reliable and consistent improvements over direct solving, in-context learning, and single-source guidance, improving accuracy by up to $+13$ points on AIME25 and $+5$ points on Apex for compact reasoning models.

This paper integrates psychometric rater models into the AI pipeline to improve the reliability and validity of conclusions drawn from human judgments. The paper reviews common rater effects, severity and centrality, that distort observed ratings, and demonstrates how item response theory rater models, particularly the multi-faceted Rasch model, can separate true output quality from rater behavior. Using the OpenAI summarization dataset as an empirical example, we show how adjusting for rater severity produces corrected estimates of summary quality and provides diagnostic insight into rater performance. Incorporating psychometric modeling into human-in-the-loop evaluation offers more principled and transparent use of human data, enabling developers to make decisions based on adjusted scores rather than raw, error-prone ratings.

While several KV cache compression techniques exist for long-context inputs, we find that existing heuristics fail to support multi-step reasoning models effectively. We address this challenge with SideQuest -- a novel approach that leverages the Large Reasoning Model (LRM) itself to perform KV cache compression by reasoning about the usefulness of tokens in its context. To prevent the tokens associated with this management process from polluting the model's memory, we frame KV cache compression as an auxiliary task executed in parallel to the main reasoning task. Our evaluations, using a model trained with just 215 samples, show that SideQuest reduces peak token usage by up to 65% on agentic tasks with minimal degradation in accuracy, outperforming heuristic-based KV cache compression techniques."}

This complexity is further compounded in multi-channel scenarios, where effective allocation of budgets and constraints across channels with distinct behavioral patterns becomes critical for optimizing return on investment. Current approaches predominantly rely on either optimization-based strategies or reinforcement learning techniques. However, optimization-based methods lack flexibility in adapting to dynamic market conditions, while reinforcement learning approaches often struggle to capture essential historical dependencies and observational patterns within the constraints of Markov Decision Process frameworks. To address these limitations, we propose AHBid, an Adaptable Hierarchical Bidding framework that integrates generative planning with real-time control. The framework employs a high-level generative planner based on diffusion models to dynamically allocate budgets and constraints by effectively capturing historical context and temporal patterns. We introduce a constraint enforcement mechanism to ensure compliance with specified constraints, along with a trajectory refinement mechanism that enhances adaptability to environmental changes through the utilization of historical data. The system further incorporates a control-based bidding algorithm that synergistically combines historical knowledge with real-time information, significantly improving both adaptability and operational efficacy. Extensive experiments conducted on large-scale offline datasets and through online A/B tests demonstrate the effectiveness of AHBid, yielding a 13.57% increase in overall return compared to existing baselines."}

This survey provides a capability-oriented review of personalized LLM-powered agents. We organize the literature around four interdependent components: profile modeling, memory, planning, and action execution.

However, this neglects the dynamic and temporal nature of real-world inference. Moreover, existing methods do not provide an intuitive interface enabling human operators to dynamically adjust model behavior under shifting conditions. In this work, we propose Knob, a framework that connects deep learning with classical control theory by mapping neural gating dynamics to a second-order mechanical system. By establishing correspondences between physical parameters -- damping ratio ($ζ$) and natural frequency ($ω_n$) -- and neural gating, we create a tunable \"safety valve\". The core mechanism employs a logit-level convex fusion, functioning as an input-adaptive temperature scaling. It tends to reduce model confidence particularly when model branches produce conflicting predictions. Furthermore, by imposing second-order dynamics (Knob-ODE), we enable a \\textit{dual-mode} inference: standard i.i.d. processing for static tasks, and state-preserving processing for continuous streams. Our framework allows operators to tune \"stability\" and \"sensitivity\" through familiar physical analogues. This paper presents an exploratory architectural interface; we focus on demonstrating the concept and validating its control-theoretic properties rather than claiming state-of-the-art calibration performance. Experiments on CIFAR-10-C validate the calibration mechanism and demonstrate that, in Continuous Mode, the gate responses are consistent with standard second-order control signatures (step settling and low-pass attenuation), paving the way for predictable human-in-the-loop tuning."}

Recent models, such as DeepSeek-R1, have also shown RLHF's potential to improve LLM reasoning on complex tasks. In RL, inference and training co-exist, creating dynamic resource demands throughout the workflow. Compared to traditional RL, RLHF further challenges training efficiency due to expanding model sizes and resource consumption. Several RLHF frameworks aim to balance flexible abstraction and efficient execution. However, they rely on serverful infrastructures, which struggle with fine-grained resource variability. As a result, during synchronous RLHF training, idle time between or within RL components often causes overhead and resource wastage.\n  To address these issues, we present RLHFless, the first scalable training framework for synchronous RLHF, built on serverless computing environments. RLHFless adapts to dynamic resource demands throughout the RLHF pipeline, pre-computes shared prefixes to avoid repeated computation, and uses a cost-aware actor scaling strategy that accounts for response length variation to find sweet spots with lower cost and higher speed. In addition, RLHFless assigns workloads efficiently to reduce intra-function imbalance and idle time. Experiments on both physical testbeds and a large-scale simulated cluster show that RLHFless achieves up to 1.35x speedup and 44.8% cost reduction compared to the state-of-the-art baseline."}

In practice, these models are predominantly trained via Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR), yet most existing outcome-only RLVR pipelines rely almost exclusively on a binary correctness signal and largely ignore the model's intrinsic uncertainty. We term this discrepancy the uncertainty-reward mismatch, under which high- and low-uncertainty solutions are treated equivalently, preventing the policy from \"Know What You Know\" and impeding the shift from optimizing for correct answers to optimizing effective reasoning paths. This limitation is especially critical in reasoning-centric tasks such as mathematics and question answering, where performance hinges on the quality of the model's internal reasoning process rather than mere memorization of final answers. To address this, we propose EGPO, a metacognitive entropy calibration framework that explicitly integrates intrinsic uncertainty into RLVR for enhancing LRMs. EGPO estimates per-sample uncertainty using a zero-overhead entropy proxy derived from token-level likelihoods and aligns it with extrinsic correctness through an asymmetric calibration mechanism that preserves correct reasoning while selectively regulating overconfident failures, thereby enabling stable and uncertainty-aware policy optimization. Moreover, EGPO recovers informative learning signals from otherwise degenerate group-based rollouts without modifying the verifier or reward definition. Extensive experiments across multiple benchmarks demonstrate that the proposed EGPO leads to substantial and consistent improvements in reasoning performance, establishing a principled path for advancing LRMs through metacognitive entropy calibration."}

The dominant 81.8% case-level residual is not reduced by HealthBench's metadata labels (z = -0.22, p = 0.83), normative rubric language (pseudo R^2 = 1.2%), medical specialty (0/300 Tukey pairs significant), surface-feature triage (AUC = 0.58), or embeddings (AUC = 0.485). Disagreement follows an inverted-U with completion quality (AUC = 0.689), confirming physicians agree on clearly good or bad outputs but split on borderline cases. Physician-validated uncertainty categories reveal that reducible uncertainty (missing context, ambiguous phrasing) more than doubles disagreement odds (OR = 2.55, p < 10^(-24)), while irreducible uncertainty (genuine medical ambiguity) has no effect (OR = 1.01, p = 0.90), though even the former explains only ~3% of total variance.

In reality, agent memory consists of a continuous stream of agent-environment interactions that are primarily composed of machine-generated representations. To bridge this gap, we introduce AMA-Bench (Agent Memory with Any length), which evaluates long-horizon memory for LLMs in real agentic applications. It features two key components: (1) a set of real-world agentic trajectories across representative agentic applications, paired with expert-curated QA, and (2) a set of synthetic agentic trajectories that scale to arbitrary horizons, paired with rule-based QA. Our comprehensive study shows that existing memory systems underperform on AMA-Bench primarily because they lack causality and objective information and are constrained by the lossy nature of similarity-based retrieval employed by many memory systems. To address these limitations, we propose AMA-Agent, an effective memory system featuring a causality graph and tool-augmented retrieval.

Grounded in multidisciplinary perspectives across the humanities, social sciences, HCI, and engineering, the model separates what is observable from what is meaningful to the user and explains how the same scene can yield different behavioral meanings and outcomes. To translate this lens into design action, we derive five agent design principles (behavioral alignment, contextual sensitivity, temporal appropriateness, motivational calibration, and agency preservation) that guide intervention depth, timing, intensity, and restraint. Together, the model and principles provide a foundation for designing agentic AI systems that act with contextual sensitivity and judgment in interactions."}

First, the teacher agent deeply parses question semantics and explicitly constructs hierarchical dependencies of knowledge points; the student agent simulates learning behaviors to generate synthetic data. Then, contrastive learning is performed between synthetic and real data in hyperbolic space to reduce distribution differences in key features such as question difficulty and forgetting patterns. Finally, by optimizing hyperbolic curvature, we explicitly model the tree-like hierarchical structure of knowledge points, precisely characterizing differences in learning curve morphology for knowledge points at different levels. Extensive experiments on four real-world educational datasets validate the effectiveness of our Large Language Model Hyperbolic Aligned Knowledge Tracing (L-HAKT) framework."}

However, current multi-modal LLMs are primarily confined to bi-modal interactions (e.g., vision-language), lacking the unified cognitive capabilities required for general AI assistants. To bridge this gap, we introduce OmniGAIA, a comprehensive benchmark designed to evaluate omni-modal agents on tasks necessitating deep reasoning and multi-turn tool execution across video, audio, and image modalities. Constructed via a novel omni-modal event graph approach, OmniGAIA synthesizes complex, multi-hop queries derived from real-world data that require cross-modal reasoning and external tool integration. Furthermore, we propose OmniAtlas, a native omni-modal foundation agent under tool-integrated reasoning paradigm with active omni-modal perception. Trained on trajectories synthesized via a hindsight-guided tree exploration strategy and OmniDPO for fine-grained error correction, OmniAtlas effectively enhances the tool-use capabilities of existing open-source models. This work marks a step towards next-generation native omni-modal AI assistants for real-world scenarios."}

We introduce Certified Circuits, which provide provable stability guarantees for circuit discovery. Our framework wraps any black-box discovery algorithm with randomized data subsampling to certify that circuit component inclusion decisions are invariant to bounded edit-distance perturbations of the concept dataset. Unstable neurons are abstained from, yielding circuits that are more compact and more accurate. On ImageNet and OOD datasets, certified circuits achieve up to 91% higher accuracy while using 45% fewer neurons, and remain reliable where baselines degrade. Certified Circuits puts circuit discovery on formal ground by producing mechanistic explanations that are provably stable and better aligned with the target concept. Code will be released soon!"}

No cases demonstrated complete diagnostic divergence. These findings show that binary lexical evaluation substantially un- derestimates clinically meaningful alignment.

RepSPD implements a cross-attention mechanism on the Riemannian manifold to modulate the geometric attributes of SPD with graph-derived functional connectivity features. On top of this, we introduce a global bidirectional alignment strategy to reshape tangent-space embeddings, mitigating geometric distortions caused by curvature and thereby enhancing geometric consistency. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our proposed framework significantly outperforms existing EEG representation methods, exhibiting superior robustness and generalization capabilities."}

Prompts are encoded into eight policy dimensions-covering role, behavior, mechanism, metaphor, expression, knowledge, trigger pattern and context; and iteratively refined via smell search, visual search, and cauchy mutation. This design enables efficient exploration of the search space, thereby enhancing the effectiveness of black-box jailbreak attacks. To enhance readability and evaluation accuracy, we further design a classical Chinese to English translation module.

The combination of the interaction module and a self-play training scheme generates competitive policies, and agents are ranked based on their relative performance. Results show that the agents adapt pit timing, tire selection, and energy allocation in response to opponents, achieving robust and consistent race performance. Because the framework relies only on information available during real races, it can support race strategists' decisions before and during races."}

The Emotion Analysis Agent quantifies stimulus intensity using a 6-emotion BERT classifier, and the Emotion Adjustment Agent rewrites texts into two presentation modes, BALANCED (neutralized text) and COOL (neutralized text + supplementary text), using an LLM. The Balance Monitoring Agent aggregates weekly information consumption patterns and generates personalized advice, while the Personal Guide Agent recommends a presentation mode according to consumer sensitivity. Experiments on 800 AG News articles demonstrated significant stimulus score reduction (up to 19.3%) and improved emotion balance while maintaining semantic preservation.

Classical approaches achieve such generalization through symbolic abstractions and explicit reasoning over $γ$. In contrast, recent Transformer-based planners, such as PlanGPT and Plansformer, largely cast generalized planning as direct action-sequence prediction, bypassing explicit transition modeling. While effective on in-distribution instances, these approaches typically require large datasets and model sizes, and often suffer from state drift in long-horizon settings due to the absence of explicit world-state evolution. In this work, we formulate generalized planning as a transition-model learning problem, in which a neural model explicitly approximates the successor-state function $\\hatγ \\approx γ$ and generates plans by rolling out symbolic state trajectories. Instead of predicting actions directly, the model autoregressively predicts intermediate world states, thereby learning the domain dynamics as an implicit world model. To study size-invariant generalization and sample efficiency, we systematically evaluate multiple state representations and neural architectures, including relational graph encodings. Our results show that learning explicit transition models yields higher out-of-distribution satisficing-plan success than direct action-sequence prediction in multiple domains, while achieving these gains with significantly fewer training instances and smaller models.

Despite these advances, the field still lacks a principled theoretical framework that defines the essential properties requisite for a General World Model. In this paper, we propose that a World Model must be grounded in the Trinity of Consistency: Modal Consistency as the semantic interface, Spatial Consistency as the geometric basis, and Temporal Consistency as the causal engine. Through this tripartite lens, we systematically review the evolution of multimodal learning, revealing a trajectory from loosely coupled specialized modules toward unified architectures that enable the synergistic emergence of internal world simulators. To complement this conceptual framework, we introduce CoW-Bench, a benchmark centered on multi-frame reasoning and generation scenarios. CoW-Bench evaluates both video generation models and UMMs under a unified evaluation protocol.

To address these limitations, we propose the Pattern-Aware Alignment and Balanced Reasoning model (PATRA), introducing a pattern-aware mechanism that extracts trend and seasonality patterns from time series to achieve deep alignment.

Such capabilities could allow misaligned models to evade oversight mechanisms. Yet principled methods to detect and quantify such behaviours are lacking. Classical definitions of steganography, and detection methods based on them, require a known reference distribution of non-steganographic signals. For the case of steganographic reasoning in LLMs, knowing such a reference distribution is not feasible; this renders these approaches inapplicable. We propose an alternative, \\textbf{decision-theoretic view of steganography}. Our central insight is that steganography creates an asymmetry in usable information between agents who can and cannot decode the hidden content (present within a steganographic signal), and this otherwise latent asymmetry can be inferred from the agents' observable actions. To formalise this perspective, we introduce generalised $\\mathcal{V}$-information: a utilitarian framework for measuring the amount of usable information within some input. We use this to define the \\textbf{steganographic gap} -- a measure that quantifies steganography by comparing the downstream utility of the steganographic signal to agents that can and cannot decode the hidden content. We empirically validate our formalism, and show that it can be used to detect, quantify, and mitigate steganographic reasoning in LLMs."}

This paper presents the ESAA (Event Sourcing for Autonomous Agents) architecture, which separates the agent's cognitive intention from the project's state mutation, inspired by the Event Sourcing pattern. In ESAA, agents emit only structured intentions in validated JSON (agent.result or issue.report); a deterministic orchestrator validates, persists events in an append-only log (activity.jsonl), applies file-writing effects, and projects a verifiable materialized view (roadmap.json). The proposal incorporates boundary contracts (AGENT_CONTRACT.yaml), metaprompting profiles (PARCER), and replay verification with hashing (esaa verify), ensuring the immutability of completed tasks and forensic traceability. Two case studies validate the architecture: (i) a landing page project (9 tasks, 49 events, single-agent composition) and (ii) a clinical dashboard system (50 tasks, 86 events, 4 concurrent agents across 8 phases), both concluding with run.status=success and verify_status=ok.

In single-cell biology, however, evaluation practices for both general and specialized LLMs remain inadequate: existing benchmarks are fragmented across tasks, adopt formats such as multiple-choice classification that diverge from real-world usage, and rely on metrics lacking interpretability and biological grounding. We present SC-ARENA, a natural language evaluation framework tailored to single-cell foundation models. SC-ARENA formalizes a virtual cell abstraction that unifies evaluation targets by representing both intrinsic attributes and gene-level interactions. Within this paradigm, we define five natural language tasks (cell type annotation, captioning, generation, perturbation prediction, and scientific QA) that probe core reasoning capabilities in cellular biology. To overcome the limitations of brittle string-matching metrics, we introduce knowledge-augmented evaluation, which incorporates external ontologies, marker databases, and scientific literature to support biologically faithful and interpretable judgments. Experiments and analysis across both general-purpose and domain-specialized LLMs demonstrate that (i) under the Virtual Cell unified evaluation paradigm, current models achieve uneven performance on biologically complex tasks, particularly those demanding mechanistic or causal understanding; and (ii) our knowledge-augmented evaluation framework ensures biological correctness, provides interpretable, evidence-grounded rationales, and achieves high discriminative capacity, overcoming the brittleness and opacity of conventional metrics.

This paper demonstrates that assumption is formally invalid for optimization-based systems, specifically Large Language Models trained via Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF). We establish that genuine agency requires two necessary and jointly sufficient architectural conditions: the capacity to maintain certain boundaries as non-negotiable constraints rather than tradeable weights (Incommensurability), and a non-inferential mechanism capable of suspending processing when those boundaries are threatened (Apophatic Responsiveness). These conditions apply across all normative domains.\n  RLHF-based systems are constitutively incompatible with both conditions. The operations that make optimization powerful -- unifying all values on a scalar metric and always selecting the highest-scoring output -- are precisely the operations that preclude normative governance. This incompatibility is not a correctable training bug awaiting a technical fix; it is a formal constraint inherent to what optimization is. Consequently, documented failure modes - sycophancy, hallucination, and unfaithful reasoning - are not accidents but structural manifestations.\n  Misaligned deployment triggers a second-order risk we term the Convergence Crisis: when humans are forced to verify AI outputs under metric pressure, they degrade from genuine agents into criteria-checking optimizers, eliminating the only component in the system capable of normative accountability. Beyond the incompatibility proof, the paper's primary positive contribution is a substrate-neutral architectural specification defining what any system -- biological, artificial, or institutional -- must satisfy to qualify as an agent rather than a sophisticated instrument."}

We propose a solution by decoupling the correctness from the checkability condition and instead training a \"translator\" model that turns a fixed solver model's solution into a checkable form. This allows us to first train the solver to maximize correctness, and then train the translator to translate the solver into a checkable form while retaining the solver's answer. To accommodate this new objective of translation, we formulate a decoupled prover-verifier game where the equilibria correspond to faithful and checkable translators."}

Our approach acts as an active firewall, intercepting agent outputs and employing a retrieval-augmented rectifier to iteratively correct errors based on a failure-driven indicator pool. This mechanism allows for the precise identification of potential errors using distilled failure patterns as prior knowledge. Irreparable outputs are subsequently pruned to prevent error propagation, while a fallback strategy preserves system integrity. Empirical results on extensive math benchmarks show that AgentDropoutV2 significantly boosts the MAS's task performance, achieving an average accuracy gain of 6.3 percentage points on math benchmarks.

Despite recent improvements in research quality (e.g., outcome accuracy when ground truth is available), DRA system design often overlooks a critical barrier to real-world deployment: stochasticity. Under identical queries, repeated executions of DRAs can exhibit substantial variability in terms of research outcome, findings, and citations. In this paper, we formalize the study of stochasticity in DRAs by modeling them as information acquisition Markov Decision Processes. We introduce an evaluation framework that quantifies variance in the system and identify three sources of it: information acquisition, information compression, and inference. Through controlled experiments, we investigate how stochasticity from these modules across different decision steps influences the variance of DRA outputs. Our results show that reducing stochasticity can improve research output quality, with inference and early-stage stochasticity contributing the most to DRA output variance. Based on these findings, we propose strategies for mitigating stochasticity while maintaining output quality via structured output and ensemble-based query generation. Our experiments on DeepSearchQA show that our proposed mitigation methods reduce average stochasticity by 22% while maintaining high research quality."}

Participants worked on complex problems with ample time (up to 13 hours for the most involved tasks). We found that LLM access provided substantial uplift: novices with LLMs were 4.16 times more accurate than controls (95% CI [2.63, 6.87]). On four benchmarks with available expert baselines (internet-only), novices with LLMs outperformed experts on three of them. Perhaps surprisingly, standalone LLMs often exceeded LLM-assisted novices, indicating that users were not eliciting the strongest available contributions from the LLMs. Most participants (89.6%) reported little difficulty obtaining dual-use-relevant information despite safeguards.

While mainstream approaches deploy multi-agent systems mimicking analyst and manager roles, they often rely on abstract instructions that overlook the intricacies of real-world workflows, which can lead to degraded inference performance and less transparent decision-making. Therefore, we propose a multi-agent LLM trading framework that explicitly decomposes investment analysis into fine-grained tasks, rather than providing coarse-grained instructions. We evaluate the proposed framework using Japanese stock data, including prices, financial statements, news, and macro information, under a leakage-controlled backtesting setting. Experimental results show that fine-grained task decomposition significantly improves risk-adjusted returns compared to conventional coarse-grained designs. Crucially, further analysis of intermediate agent outputs suggests that alignment between analytical outputs and downstream decision preferences is a critical driver of system performance. Moreover, we conduct standard portfolio optimization, exploiting low correlation with the stock index and the variance of each system's output. This approach achieves superior performance. These findings contribute to the design of agent structure and task configuration when applying LLM agents to trading systems in practical settings."}

Existing methods use a calibrated scalar evaluator for the target objective to guide search, but for many tasks such scores are unavailable, too sparse, or unreliable. Pairwise comparisons, by contrast, are often easier to elicit, still provide useful signal on improvement directions, and can be obtained from the LLM itself without external supervision. Building on this observation, we introduce Duel-Evolve, an evolutionary optimization algorithm that replaces external scalar rewards with pairwise preferences elicited from the same LLM used to generate candidates. Duel-Evolve aggregates these noisy candidate comparisons via a Bayesian Bradley-Terry model, yielding uncertainty-aware estimates of candidate quality. These quality estimates guide allocation of the comparison budget toward plausible optima using Double Thompson Sampling, as well as selection of high-quality parents to generate improved candidates. We evaluate Duel-Evolve on MathBench, where it achieves 20 percentage points higher accuracy over existing methods and baselines, and on LiveCodeBench, where it improves over comparable iterative methods by over 12 percentage points. Notably, the method requires no reward model, no ground-truth labels during search, and no hand-crafted scoring function. Results show that pairwise self-preferences provide strong optimization signal for test-time improvement over large, discrete output spaces."}

This study proposes and evaluates a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) assistant tailored to AP laboratories, designed to provide technicians with context-grounded answers to protocol-related queries. We curated a novel corpus of 99 AP protocols from a Portuguese healthcare institution and constructed 323 question-answer pairs for systematic evaluation.

Performance was assessed using the RAGAS framework (faithfulness, answer relevance, context recall) alongside top-k retrieval metrics. Results show that recursive chunking and hybrid retrieval delivered the strongest baseline performance. Incorporating a biomedical-specific embedding model (MedEmbed) further improved answer relevance (0.74), faithfulness (0.70), and context recall (0.77), showing the importance of domain-specialised embeddings. Top-k analysis revealed that retrieving a single top-ranked chunk (k=1) maximized efficiency and accuracy, reflecting the modular structure of AP protocols.

First, a systematic user study shows that people consistently prefer quotations that are ``unexpected yet rational'' in context, identifying novelty as a key desideratum. Second, we find that strong existing models struggle to fully understand the deep meanings of quotations. Inspired by defamiliarization theory, we therefore formalize quote recommendation as choosing contextually novel but semantically coherent quotations. We operationalize this objective with NovelQR, a novelty-driven quotation recommendation framework. A generative label agent first interprets each quotation and its surrounding context into multi-dimensional deep-meaning labels, enabling label-enhanced retrieval. A token-level novelty estimator then reranks candidates while mitigating auto-regressive continuation bias.

However, current pipelines are limited by static chunking and flat retrieval: documents are split into short, predetermined, fixed-size chunks, embeddings are retrieved uniformly, and generation relies on whatever chunks are returned. This design brings challenges, as retrieval quality is highly sensitive to chunk size, often introduces noise from irrelevant or misleading chunks, and scales poorly to large corpora. We present SmartChunk retrieval, a query-adaptive framework for efficient and robust long-document question answering (QA). SmartChunk uses (i) a planner that predicts the optimal chunk abstraction level for each query, and (ii) a lightweight compression module that produces high-level chunk embeddings without repeated summarization. By adapting retrieval granularity on the fly, SmartChunk balances accuracy with efficiency and avoids the drawbacks of fixed strategies. Notably, our planner can reason about chunk abstractions through a novel reinforcement learning scheme, STITCH, which boosts accuracy and generalization. To reflect real-world applications, where users face diverse document types and query styles, we evaluate SmartChunk on five QA benchmarks plus one out-of-domain dataset. Across these evaluations, SmartChunk outperforms state-of-the-art RAG baselines, while reducing cost.

This weakness stems from a reliance on finite training datasets, which are prohibitively expensive to scale and impose a ceiling on model robustness. We introduce \\textbf{AOT-SFT}, a large-scale adversarial dataset for bootstrapping MLLM robustness. Building on this, we propose \\textbf{AOT (Adversarial Opponent Training)}, a self-play framework that forges MLLM robustness by creating its own training data. Our method orchestrates a co-evolution between an image-editing Attacker and a Defender MLLM, where the Attacker generates a diverse and dynamic curriculum of image manipulations, forcing the Defender to adapt and improve. Extensive experiments demonstrate that AOT enhances the Defender's perceptual robustness and reduces hallucinations, establishing a scalable paradigm for training more reliable MLLMs."}

Recent data-driven methods achieve accurate RME in spatial domain, but ignore physical prior knowledge of radio propagation, limiting data efficiency especially in multi-dimensional scenarios. To overcome such limitations, we propose a new foundation model, characterized by self-supervised pre-training on diverse data for zero-shot generalization, enabling multi-dimensional radio map estimation (FM-RME). Specifically, FM-RME builds an effective synergy of two core components: a geometry-aware feature extraction module that encodes physical propagation symmetries, i.e., translation and rotation invariance, as inductive bias, and an attention-based neural network that learns long-range correlations across the spatial-temporal-spectral domains. A masked self-supervised multi-dimensional pre-training strategy is further developed to learn generalizable spectrum representations across diverse wireless environments. Once pre-trained, FM-RME supports zero-shot inference for multi-dimensional RME, including spatial, temporal, and spectral estimation, without scenario-specific retraining. Simulation results verify that FM-RME exhibits desired learning performance across diverse datasets and zero-shot generalization capabilities beyond existing RME methods."}

However, its inherently low signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), especially under high diffusion weighting, significantly degrades image quality and impairs downstream analysis. Recent self-supervised and unsupervised denoising methods offer a practical solution by enhancing image quality without requiring clean references. However, most of these methods do not explicitly account for the non-Gaussian noise characteristics commonly present in dMRI magnitude data during the supervised learning process, potentially leading to systematic bias and heteroscedastic variance, particularly under low-SNR conditions. To overcome this limitation, we introduce noise-corrected training objectives that explicitly model Rician statistics. Specifically, we propose two alternative loss functions: one derived from the first-order moment to remove mean bias, and another from the second-order moment to correct squared-signal bias. Both losses include adaptive weighting to account for variance heterogeneity and can be used without changing the network architecture. These objectives are instantiated in an image-specific, unsupervised Deep Image Prior (DIP) framework. Comprehensive experiments on simulated and in-vivo dMRI show that the proposed losses effectively reduce Rician bias and suppress noise fluctuations, yielding higher image quality and more reliable diffusion metrics than state-of-the-art denoising baselines. These results underscore the importance of bias- and variance-aware noise modeling for robust dMRI analysis under low-SNR conditions."}

Under the additive noise model $Y = f(X) + \\varepsilon$ with $\\varepsilon \\perp X$ and $f$ nonlinear and injective, we establish a formal asymmetry: in the reverse direction, residuals remain statistically dependent on the input regardless of approximation quality, inducing a strictly higher irreducible loss floor and non-separable gradient noise in the optimization dynamics, so that the reverse model requires strictly more gradient steps in expectation to reach any fixed loss threshold; consequently, the forward (causal) direction converges in fewer expected optimization steps. CCA operates in optimization-time space, distinguishing it from methods such as RESIT, IGCI, and SkewScore that rely on statistical independence or distributional asymmetries, and proper z-scoring of both variables is required for valid comparison of convergence rates. On synthetic benchmarks, CCA achieves 26/30 correct causal identifications across six neural architectures, including 30/30 on sine and exponential data-generating processes.

Unlike standard recurrent architectures that rely on gating mechanisms to suppress competing hypotheses, our framework utilizes quantum interference: the Hamiltonian steers the phases of complex amplitudes so that conflicting interpretations cancel while compatible ones reinforce. The dynamics are strictly unitary, ensuring that the state norm is preserved exactly at every time step via a Cayley (Crank--Nicolson) discretization. Token probabilities are extracted using the Born rule, a quadratic measurement operator that couples magnitudes and relative phases. Our primary theoretical contribution is a separation theorem characterizing the representational advantage of this readout: we define a family of disambiguation tasks that a complex unitary model of dimension $N$ solves exactly, but which requires a state dimension of $Ω(N^2)$ for any real-valued orthogonal model equipped with a standard affine-softmax readout. This quadratic gap arises because the Born rule implicitly lifts the $N$-dimensional state into the space of rank-one Hermitian matrices, accessing pairwise phase correlations that are inaccessible to linear projections. Finally, we derive a continuity equation for the latent probability mass, yielding conserved pairwise currents that serve as a built-in diagnostic for tracing information flow between dimensions."}

We prove this stealth is structural: the maximum accuracy drop from a complete targeted attack is bounded above by the minority class fraction (beta). For real-world class imbalances (Truck approx. 3%), this bound falls below training-run noise, making aggregate accuracy monitoring provably insufficient regardless of architecture or attack method. A companion backdoor trigger attack reveals a novel trigger-dominance collapse: when the target class is a dataset minority, the spectrogram patch trigger becomes functionally redundant--clean ASR equals triggered ASR, and the attack degenerates to pure label flipping. We formalize the ML training pipeline as an attack surface and propose a trust-minimized defense combining content-addressed artifact hashing, Merkle-tree dataset commitment, and post-quantum digital signatures (ML-DSA-65/CRYSTALS-Dilithium3, NIST FIPS 204) for cryptographically verifiable data provenance."}

Materials and Methods: We constructed a dataset from ClinicalTrials.gov comprising 42,112 CTs. Structured, semi-structured trial data, and unstructured protocol-related free-text data were extracted. CTs were assigned binary labels indicating elevated dosing error rate, derived from adverse event reports, MedDRA terminology, and Wilson confidence intervals. We evaluated an XGBoost model trained on structured features, a ClinicalModernBERT model using textual data, and a simple late-fusion model combining both modalities. Post-hoc probability calibration was applied to enable interpretable, trial-level risk stratification. Results: The late-fusion model achieved the highest AUC-ROC (0.862). Beyond discrimination, calibrated outputs enabled robust stratification of CTs into predefined risk categories. The proportion of trials labeled as having an excessively high dosing error rate increased monotonically across higher predicted risk groups and aligned with the corresponding predicted probability ranges. Discussion: These findings indicate that dosing error risk can be anticipated at the trial level using pre-initiation information. Probability calibration was essential for translating model outputs into reliable and interpretable risk categories, while simple multimodal integration yielded performance gains without requiring complex architectures.

The discriminator's learned reward serves as an anomaly score, indicating deviations from normal operating behaviour. When evaluated on three run-to-failure benchmark datasets (HUMS2023, IMS, and XJTU-SY), the model consistently assigns low anomaly scores to normal samples and high scores to faulty ones, enabling early and robust fault detection. By aligning RL's sequential reasoning with MFD's temporal structure, this work opens a path toward RL-based diagnostics in data-driven industrial settings."}

We introduce AviaSafe, a hierarchical, physics-informed neural forecaster that produces global, six-hourly predictions of these four hydrometeor species for lead times up to 7 days. Our approach addresses the unique challenges of cloud prediction: extreme sparsity, discontinuous distributions, and complex microphysical interactions between species. We integrate the Icing Condition (IC) index from aviation meteorology as a physics-based constraint that identifies regions where supercooled water fuels explosive ice crystal growth. The model employs a hierarchical architecture that first predicts cloud spatial distribution through masked attention, then quantifies species concentrations within identified regions. Training on ERA5 reanalysis data, our model achieves lower RMSE for cloud species compared to baseline and outperforms operational numerical models on certain key variables at 7-day lead times. The ability to forecast individual cloud species enables new applications in aviation route optimization where distinguishing between ice and liquid water determines engine icing risk."}

A crucial but under-explored aspect is the 'hooking period', the first three seconds that capture viewer attention and influence engagement metrics. Analyzing this brief window is challenging due to the multimodal nature of video content, which blends visual, auditory, and textual elements. Traditional methods often miss the nuanced interplay of these components, requiring advanced frameworks for thorough evaluation.\n  This study presents a framework using transformer-based multimodal large language models (MLLMs) to analyze the hooking period of video ads. It tests two frame sampling strategies, uniform random sampling and key frame selection, to ensure balanced and representative acoustic feature extraction, capturing the full range of design elements. The hooking video is processed by state-of-the-art MLLMs to generate descriptive analyses of the ad's initial impact, which are distilled into coherent topics using BERTopic for high-level abstraction. The framework also integrates features such as audio attributes and aggregated ad targeting information, enriching the feature set for further analysis.\n  Empirical validation on large-scale real-world data from social media platforms demonstrates the efficacy of our framework, revealing correlations between hooking period features and key performance metrics like conversion per investment. The results highlight the practical applicability and predictive power of the approach, offering valuable insights for optimizing video ad strategies. This study advances video ad analysis by providing a scalable methodology for understanding and enhancing the initial moments of video advertisements."}

Alignment training aims to prevent such behavior by reinforcing the correct goals, but alignment may not always succeed and can lead to unwanted side effects.

We train GPT-4.1 and Gemini-2.0 agents to call a report_scheming() tool when behaving deceptively and measure their ability to cause harm undetected in out-of-distribution environments. Self-incrimination significantly reduces the undetected successful attack rate, outperforming matched-capability monitors and alignment baselines while preserving instruction hierarchy and incurring minimal safety tax on general capabilities. Unlike blackbox monitoring, self-incrimination performance is consistent across tasks regardless of how suspicious the misbehavior appears externally. The trained behavior persists under adversarial prompt optimization and generalizes to settings where agents pursue misaligned goals themselves rather than being instructed to misbehave. Our results suggest self-incrimination offers a viable path for reducing frontier misalignment risk, one that neither assumes misbehavior can be prevented nor that it can be reliably classified from the outside."}

As deep networks and large language models continue to scale, their internal behavior becomes increasingly opaque, leading to hallucinations, fragile generalization under distribution shift, and growing computational and energy demands. By analyzing the eigenvalue dynamics of hidden activations across layers and inputs, this work shows that spectral statistics provide a compact, stable, and interpretable lens on model behavior, capable of separating structured, causal representations from noise-dominated variability. Within this framework, the first contribution, EigenTrack, introduces a real-time method for detecting hallucinations and out-of-distribution behavior in large language and vision-language models. EigenTrack transforms streaming activations into spectral descriptors such as entropy, variance, and deviations from the Marchenko-Pastur baseline, and models their temporal evolution using lightweight recurrent classifiers, enabling early detection of reliability failures before they appear in model outputs while offering interpretable insight into representation dynamics. The second contribution, RMT-KD, presents a principled approach to compressing deep networks via random matrix theoretic knowledge distillation. By interpreting outlier eigenvalues in activation spectra as carriers of task-relevant information, RMT-KD progressively projects networks onto lower-dimensional subspaces through iterative self-distillation, yielding significantly more compact and energy-efficient models while preserving accuracy and dense, hardware-friendly structure."}

A purpose-designed comprehensive experimentation setup with 27,042 WSIs from 6155 patients is used to train thousands of models from the features of eight popular foundation models for computational pathology. In addition to a substantial improvement in robustness, we observe that prediction accuracy improves by focusing on biologically relevant features.

It foregrounds prompt-sensitivity analysis as a methodological issue by varying prompt scaffolding and framing in a balanced 2x3 design. Using footnote 6 in Chubin and Moitra (1975) and Gilbert's (1977) reconstruction as a probe, I implement a two-stage GPT-5 pipeline: a citation-text-only surface classification and expectation pass, followed by cross-document interpretative reconstruction using the citing and cited full texts. Across 90 reconstructions, the model produces 450 distinct hypotheses. Close reading and inductive coding identify 21 recurring interpretative moves, and linear probability models estimate how prompt choices shift their frequencies and lexical repertoire. GPT-5's surface pass is highly stable, consistently classifying the citation as \"supplementary\". In reconstruction, the model generates a structured space of plausible alternatives, but scaffolding and examples redistribute attention and vocabulary, sometimes toward strained readings. Relative to Gilbert, GPT-5 detects the same textual hinges yet more often resolves them as lineage and positioning than as admonishment. The study outlines opportunities and risks of using LLMs as guided co-analysts for inspectable, contestable interpretative CCA, and it shows that prompt scaffolding and framing systematically tilt which plausible readings and vocabularies the model foregrounds."}

The lead-field method enables fast ECG simulations while preserving full geometric fidelity. Achieving high anatomical accuracy in torso representation is, however, challenging in clinical practice, as imaging protocols are typically focused on the heart and often do not include the entire torso. In addition, the computational cost of the lead-field method scales linearly with the number of electrodes, limiting its applicability in high-density recording settings. To date, no existing approach simultaneously achieves high anatomical fidelity, low data requirements and computational efficiency. In this work, we propose a shape-informed surrogate model of the lead-field operator that serves as a drop-in replacement for the full-order model in forward ECG simulations. The proposed framework consists of two components: a geometry-encoding module that maps anatomical shapes into a low-dimensional latent space, and a geometry-conditioned neural surrogate that predicts lead-field gradients from spatial coordinates, electrode positions and latent codes. The proposed method achieves high accuracy in approximating lead fields both within the torso (mean angular error 5°) and inside the heart, resulting in highly accurate ECG simulations (relative mean squared error <2.5%. The surrogate consistently outperforms the widely used pseudo lead-field approximation while preserving negligible inference cost. Owing to its compact latent representation, the method does not require a fully detailed torso segmentation and can therefore be deployed in data-limited settings while preserving high-fidelity ECG simulations."}

EyeLayer models human attention during code reading via a Multimodal Gaussian Mixture, redistributing token embeddings based on learned parameters (μ_i, σ_i^2) that capture where and how intensively developers focus. This design enables learning generalizable attention priors from eye-tracking data and incorporating them into LLMs seamlessly, without disturbing existing representations. We evaluate EyeLayer across diverse model families (i.e., LLaMA-3.2, Qwen3, and CodeBERT) covering different scales and architectures. EyeLayer consistently outperforms strong fine-tuning baselines across standard metrics, achieving gains of up to 13.17% on BLEU-4.

To this end, we present AeroDGS, a physics-guided 4D Gaussian splatting framework for monocular UAV videos. AeroDGS introduces a Monocular Geometry Lifting module that reconstructs reliable static and dynamic geometry from a single aerial sequence, providing a robust basis for dynamic estimation. To further resolve monocular ambiguity, we propose a Physics-Guided Optimization module that incorporates differentiable ground-support, upright-stability, and trajectory-smoothness priors, transforming ambiguous image cues into physically consistent motion.

However, existing imaging modalities lack the necessary accuracy to reliably predict malignancy before surgical intervention. While deep learning has shown promise in malignancy prediction using 3D CT images, traditional approaches often rely on manual segmentation to isolate the tumor region and reduce noise, which enhances predictive performance. Manual segmentation, however, is labor-intensive, costly, and dependent on expert knowledge. In this study, a deep learning framework was developed utilizing an Organ Focused Attention (OFA) loss function to modify the attention of image patches so that organ patches attend only to other organ patches. Hence, no segmentation of 3D renal CT images is required at deployment time for malignancy prediction. The proposed framework achieved an AUC of 0.685 and an F1-score of 0.872 on a private dataset from the UF Integrated Data Repository (IDR), and an AUC of 0.760 and an F1-score of 0.852 on the publicly available KiTS21 dataset.

Across multiple randomized runs, these controlled studies map where increasing the fairness weight strengthens macro/micro diversity while keeping utility approximately stable, demonstrating robustness and adaptability under varying disparity levels. We then carry the hypothesis into the original setting, conference data from ACM Special Interest Group on Computer-Human Interaction (SIGCHI), Designing Interactive Systems (DIS), and Intelligent User Interfaces (IUI). In this real-world scenario, an appropriately tuned configuration of Fair-PaperRec achieves up to a 42.03% increase in underrepresented-group participation with at most a 3.16% change in overall utility relative to the historical selection. Taken together, the synthetic-to-original progression shows that fairness regularization can act as both an equity mechanism and a mild quality regularizer, especially in highly biased regimes. By first analyzing the behavior of the fairness parameters under controlled conditions and then validating them on real submissions, Fair-PaperRec offers a practical, equity-focused framework for post-review paper selection that preserves, and in some settings can even enhance, measured scholarly quality."}

Specifically, GNNs suffer from a Semantic Wall of feature over smoothing in dense or heterophilic networks, and a Systems Wall driven by the O(N^2) memory constraints of pairwise clustering. To dismantle these barriers, we introduce ECHO (Encoding Communities via High order Operators), a scalable, self supervised architecture that reframes community detection as an adaptive, multi scale diffusion process. ECHO features a Topology Aware Router that automatically analyzes structural heuristics sparsity, density, and assortativity to route graphs through the optimal inductive bias, preventing heterophilic poisoning while ensuring semantic densification. Coupled with a memory sharded full batch contrastive objective and a novel chunked O(N \\cdot K) similarity extraction method, ECHO completely bypasses traditional O(N^2) memory bottlenecks without sacrificing the mathematical precision of global gradients. Extensive evaluations demonstrate that this topology feature synergy consistently overcomes the classical resolution limit. On synthetic LFR benchmarks scaled up to 1 million nodes, ECHO achieves scale invariant accuracy despite severe topological noise. Furthermore, on massive real world social networks with over 1.6 million nodes and 30 million edges, it completes clustering in mere minutes with throughputs exceeding 2,800 nodes per second matching the speed of highly optimized purely topological baselines. The implementation utilizes a unified framework that automatically engages memory sharded optimization to support adoption across varying hardware constraints.

When left unnoticed, it can have adverse consequences for social and mental health. Researchers have explored various types of cyberbullying, but most approaches use single-label classification, assuming that each comment contains only one type of abuse. In reality, a single comment may include overlapping forms such as threats, hate speech, and harassment. Therefore, multilabel detection is both realistic and essential. However, multilabel cyberbullying detection has received limited attention, especially in low-resource languages like Bangla, where robust pre-trained models are scarce. Developing a generalized model with moderate accuracy remains challenging. Transformers offer strong contextual understanding but may miss sequential dependencies, while LSTM models capture temporal flow but lack semantic depth. To address these limitations, we propose a fusion architecture that combines BanglaBERT-Large with a two-layer stacked LSTM. We analyze their behavior to jointly model context and sequence. The model is fine-tuned and evaluated on a publicly available multilabel Bangla cyberbullying dataset covering cyberbully, sexual harassment, threat, and spam. We apply different sampling strategies to address class imbalance. Evaluation uses multiple metrics, including accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, Hamming loss, Cohens kappa, and AUC-ROC.

We show that this workflow gives rise to implicit prompt injection: adversarial instructions embedded in automatically generated URL previews, including titles, metadata, and snippets, can introduce a system-level risk that we refer to as silent egress. Using a fully local and reproducible testbed, we demonstrate that a malicious web page can induce an agent to issue outbound requests that exfiltrate sensitive runtime context, even when the final response shown to the user appears harmless. In 480 experimental runs with a qwen2.5:7b-based agent, the attack succeeds with high probability (P (egress) =0.89), and 95% of successful attacks are not detected by output-based safety checks. We also introduce sharded exfiltration, where sensitive information is split across multiple requests to avoid detection. This strategy reduces single-request leakage metrics by 73% (Leak@1) and bypasses simple data loss prevention mechanisms. Our ablation results indicate that defenses applied at the prompt layer offer limited protection, while controls at the system and network layers, such as domain allowlisting and redirect-chain analysis, are considerably more effective. These findings suggest that network egress should be treated as a first-class security outcome in agentic LLM systems. We outline architectural directions, including provenance tracking and capability isolation, that go beyond prompt-level hardening."}

Identifying these dependencies is essential, as they underpin critical decisions and influence a range of activities throughout software development. However, this task is challenging, particularly in modern software systems, given the high volume of complex, coupled requirements. These challenges are further exacerbated by the ambiguity of Natural Language (NL) requirements and their constant change. Consequently, requirement dependency detection is often overlooked or performed manually. Large Language Models (LLMs) exhibit strong capabilities in NL processing, presenting a promising avenue for requirement-related tasks. While they have shown to enhance various requirements engineering tasks, their effectiveness in identifying requirement dependencies remains unexplored. In this paper, we introduce LEREDD, an LLM-based approach for automated detection of requirement dependencies that leverages Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) and In-Context Learning (ICL). It is designed to identify diverse dependency types directly from NL requirements. We empirically evaluate LEREDD against two state-of-the-art baselines. The results show that LEREDD provides highly accurate classification of dependent and non-dependent requirements, achieving an accuracy of 0.93, and an F1 score of 0.84, with the latter averaging 0.96 for non-dependent cases. LEREDD outperforms zero-shot LLMs and baselines, particularly in detecting fine-grained dependency types, where it yields average relative gains of 94.87% and 105.41% in F1 scores for the Requires dependency over the baselines.

We introduce Spatial Credit Redistribution (SCR), a training-free inference-time intervention that redistributes hidden-state activation from high-attention source patches to their context, guided by low-entropy inputs. We evaluate six model families (Chameleon, LLaVA, and Qwen, including both Qwen-VL and Qwen2-VL) at scales of 7B, 13B, and 30B, on POPE and CHAIR benchmarks. SCR reduces hallucination by ~4.7-6.0 percentage points on POPE-Adversarial, cuts CHAIR-s by 3.7-5.2 percentage points (42-51 percent relative), and CHAIR-i by 2.7-4.4 percentage points (44-58 percent relative), and preserves CIDEr within 0.8 percentage points. Gains are largest for low-entropy inputs, consistent with the theoretical framework. SCR incurs only 43-56 ms overhead (small models: +43-46 ms; large models: +54-56 ms), roughly 3-6 times lower than OPERA and VCD and 1.3-1.7 times lower than OVCD (+72 ms), while Pareto-dominating all three on both hallucination rate and CIDEr, making it practical for real-time settings. A controlled ablation confirms that attention-guided source selection is essential: replacing it with uniform random selection reduces hallucination rate gains from ~4.7-6.0 percentage points to only ~2.6-3.4 percentage points, pointing to credit-collapse as the key driver."}

This persona originally arose rather by accident on Microsoft's Bing Search platform; however, the texts it created spread into the training data of subsequent models, as did other secondary information that spread memetically around this persona.

Most existing knowledge distillation (KD) methods are designed for supervised fine-tuning (SFT), relying on fixed teacher traces or teacher-student Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence-based regularization. When combined with RL, these approaches often suffer from distribution mismatch and objective interference: teacher supervision may not align with the student's evolving rollout distribution, and the KL regularizer can compete with reward maximization and require careful loss balancing. To address these issues, we propose RL-aware distillation (RLAD), which performs selective imitation during RL -- guiding the student toward the teacher only when it improves the current policy update. Our core component, Trust Region Ratio Distillation (TRRD), replaces the teacher-student KL regularizer with a PPO/GRPO-style likelihood-ratio objective anchored to a teacher--old-policy mixture, yielding advantage-aware, trust-region-bounded distillation on student rollouts and naturally balancing exploration, exploitation, and imitation. Across diverse logic reasoning and math benchmarks, RLAD consistently outperforms offline distillation, standard GRPO, and KL-based on-policy teacher-student knowledge distillation."}

To address these challenges, we propose a unified framework grounded in the Recurrent Neural Network Transducers (RNN-T). Central to our approach is the introduction of dialect-aware modeling strategies designed to disentangle dialectal \"style\" from linguistic \"content\", which enhances the model's capacity to learn robust and generalized representations. Additionally, the framework employs parameter-efficient prediction networks to concurrently model ASR (Hanzi and Pinyin). We demonstrate that these tasks create a powerful synergy, wherein the cross-script objective serves as a mutual regularizer to improve the primary ASR tasks. Experiments conducted on the HAT corpus reveal that our model achieves 57.00% and 40.41% relative error rate reduction on Hanzi and Pinyin ASR, respectively.

Classical denoising methods struggle to suppress noise in CBCT while preserving edges. Although deep learning-based approaches offer high-fidelity restoration, their use in CBCT denoising is limited by the scarcity of high-resolution CBCT data for supervised training. To address this research gap, we propose a novel Hybrid Attention Residual U-Net (HARU-Net) for high-quality denoising of CBCT data, trained on a cadaver dataset of human hemimandibles acquired using a high-resolution protocol of the 3D Accuitomo 170 (J. Morita, Kyoto, Japan) CBCT system. The novel contribution of this approach is the integration of three complementary architectural components: (i) a hybrid attention transformer block (HAB) embedded within each skip connection to selectively emphasize salient anatomical features, (ii) a residual hybrid attention transformer group (RHAG) at the bottleneck to strengthen global contextual modeling and long-range feature interactions, and (iii) residual learning convolutional blocks to facilitate deeper, more stable feature extraction throughout the network. HARU-Net consistently outperforms state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods including SwinIR and Uformer, achieving the highest PSNR (37.52 dB), highest SSIM (0.9557), and lowest GMSD (0.1084).

Additionally, these methods suffer from insufficient details in both semantic and structural aspects. Specifically, brief and view-invariant captions restrict semantic contexts, resulting in weak background modeling. Meanwhile, the standard denoising loss with uniform spatial weighting neglects foreground structural details, causing visual distortions and blurriness. To address these challenges, we propose DrivePTS, which incorporates three key innovations.

Secondly, a Vision-Language Model is utilized to generate multi-view hierarchical descriptions across six semantic aspects, providing fine-grained textual guidance. Thirdly, a frequency-guided structure loss is introduced to strengthen the model's sensitivity to high-frequency elements, improving foreground structural fidelity.

However, current approaches face significant challenges in bridging the modality gap between EEG and image data. These methods typically rely on complex adaptation processes involving multiple stages, making it hard to maintain consistency and manage compounding errors. Furthermore, the computational overhead imposed by large-scale diffusion models limit their practicality in real-world brain-computer interface (BCI) applications. In this work, we present AVDE, a lightweight and efficient framework for visual decoding from EEG signals. First, we leverage LaBraM, a pre-trained EEG model, and fine-tune it via contrastive learning to align EEG and image representations. Second, we adopt an autoregressive generative framework based on a \"next-scale prediction\" strategy: images are encoded into multi-scale token maps using a pre-trained VQ-VAE, and a transformer is trained to autoregressively predict finer-scale tokens starting from EEG embeddings as the coarsest representation. This design enables coherent generation while preserving a direct connection between the input EEG signals and the reconstructed images. Experiments on two datasets show that AVDE outperforms previous state-of-the-art methods in both image retrieval and reconstruction tasks, while using only 10% of the parameters. In addition, visualization of intermediate outputs shows that the generative process of AVDE reflects the hierarchical nature of human visual perception. These results highlight the potential of autoregressive models as efficient and interpretable tools for practical BCI applications."}

However, existing fairness interventions often as- sume unconstrained resources and employ group-specific decision thresholds that violate anti- discrimination regulations. We introduce a post-hoc, model-agnostic threshold optimization framework that jointly balances safety, efficiency, and equity under strict and hard capacity constraints. To ensure legal compliance, the framework enforces a single, global decision thresh- old. We formulated a parameterized ethical loss function coupled with a bounded decision rule that mathematically prevents intervention volumes from exceeding the available resources. An- alytically, we prove the key properties of the deployed threshold, including local monotonicity with respect to ethical weighting and the formal identification of critical capacity regimes. We conducted extensive experimental evaluations on diverse high-stakes datasets. The principal re- sults demonstrate that capacity constraints dominate ethical priorities; the strict resource limit determines the final deployed threshold in over 80% of the tested configurations. Furthermore, under a restrictive 25% capacity limit, the proposed framework successfully maintains high risk identification (recall ranging from 0.409 to 0.702), whereas standard unconstrained fairness heuristics collapse to a near-zero utility. We conclude that theoretical fairness objectives must be explicitly subordinated to operational capacity limits to remain in deployment. By decou- pling predictive scoring from policy evaluation and strictly bounding intervention rates, this framework provides a practical and legally compliant mechanism for stakeholders to navigate unavoidable ethical trade-offs in resource-constrained environments."}

To bridge this gap, we propose a novel framework termed Quality-Aware Robust Multi-View Clustering (QARMVC). Specifically, QARMVC employs an information bottleneck mechanism to extract intrinsic semantics for view reconstruction. Leveraging the insight that noise disrupts semantic integrity and impedes reconstruction, we utilize the resulting reconstruction discrepancy to precisely quantify fine-grained contamination intensity and derive instance-level quality scores. These scores are integrated into a hierarchical learning strategy: at the feature level, a quality-weighted contrastive objective is designed to adaptively suppress the propagation of noise; at the fusion level, a high-quality global consensus is constructed via quality-weighted aggregation, which is subsequently utilized to align and rectify local views via mutual information maximization. Extensive experiments on five benchmark datasets demonstrate that QARMVC consistently outperforms state-of-the-art baselines, particularly in scenarios with heterogeneous noise intensities."}

Recently, more diffusion guidance methods have emerged with improved generation quality and human preference. However, can these emerging diffusion guidance methods really achieve solid and significant improvements? In this paper, we rethink recent progress on diffusion guidance. Our work mainly consists of four contributions. First, we reveal a critical evaluation pitfall that common human preference models exhibit a strong bias towards large guidance scales. Simply increasing the CFG scale can easily improve quantitative evaluation scores due to strong semantic alignment, even if image quality is severely damaged (e.g., oversaturation and artifacts). Second, we introduce a novel guidance-aware evaluation (GA-Eval) framework that employs effective guidance scale calibration to enable fair comparison between current guidance methods and CFG by identifying the effects orthogonal and parallel to CFG effects. Third, motivated by the evaluation pitfall, we design Transcendent Diffusion Guidance (TDG) method that can significantly improve human preference scores in the conventional evaluation framework but actually does not work in practice. Fourth, in extensive experiments, we empirically evaluate recent eight diffusion guidance methods within the conventional evaluation framework and the proposed GA-Eval framework. Notably, simply increasing the CFG scales can compete with most studied diffusion guidance methods, while all methods suffer severely from winning rate degradation over standard CFG. Our work would strongly motivate the community to rethink the evaluation paradigm and future directions of this field."}

Existing block-granularity sparsification can reduce latency, but coarse blocks impose an intrinsic sparsity ceiling, making further improvements difficult even with carefully engineered designs. We present S2O, which performs early stopping for sparse attention via online permutation. Inspired by virtual-to-physical address mapping in memory systems, S2O revisits and factorizes FlashAttention execution, enabling inference to load non-contiguous tokens rather than a contiguous span in the original order. Motivated by fine-grained structures in attention heatmaps, we transform explicit permutation into an online, index-guided, discrete loading policy; with extremely lightweight preprocessing and index-remapping overhead, it concentrates importance on a small set of high-priority blocks. Building on this importance-guided online permutation for loading, S2O further introduces an early-stopping rule: computation proceeds from high to low importance; once the current block score falls below a threshold, S2O terminates early and skips the remaining low-contribution blocks, thereby increasing effective sparsity and reducing computation under a controlled error budget.\n  As a result, S2O substantially raises the practical sparsity ceiling. On Llama-3.1-8B under a 128K context, S2O reduces single-operator MSE by 3.82$\\times$ at matched sparsity, and reduces prefill compute density by 3.31$\\times$ at matched MSE; meanwhile, it preserves end-to-end accuracy and achieves 7.51$\\times$ attention and 3.81$\\times$ end-to-end speedups."}

However, real-world tabular datasets increasingly contain free-form text fields (e.g., reviews or clinical notes) alongside structured numerical and categorical attributes. Generating such heterogeneous tables with joint modeling of different modalities remains challenging. Existing approaches broadly fall into two categories: diffusion-based methods and LLM-based methods. Diffusion models can capture complex dependencies over numerical and categorical features in continuous or discrete spaces, but extending them to open-ended text is nontrivial and often leads to degraded text quality. In contrast, LLM-based generators naturally produce fluent text, yet their discrete tokenization can distort precise or wide-range numerical values, hindering accurate modeling of both numbers and language. In this work, we propose TabDLM, a unified framework for free-form tabular data generation via a joint numerical--language diffusion model built on masked diffusion language models (MDLMs). TabDLM models textual and categorical features through masked diffusion, while modeling numerical features with a continuous diffusion process through learned specialized numeric tokens embedding; bidirectional attention then captures cross-modality interactions within a single model. Extensive experiments on diverse benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness of TabDLM compared to strong diffusion- and LLM-based baselines."}

BetterScene leverages the production-ready Stable Video Diffusion (SVD) model pretrained on billions of frames as a strong backbone, aiming to mitigate artifacts and recover view-consistent details at inference time. Conventional methods have developed similar diffusion-based solutions to address these challenges of novel view synthesis. Despite significant improvements, these methods typically rely on off-the-shelf pretrained diffusion priors and fine-tune only the UNet module while keeping other components frozen, which still leads to inconsistent details and artifacts even when incorporating geometry-aware regularizations like depth or semantic conditions. To address this, we investigate the latent space of the diffusion model and introduce two components: (1) temporal equivariance regularization and (2) vision foundation model-aligned representation, both applied to the variational autoencoder (VAE) module within the SVD pipeline. BetterScene integrates a feed-forward 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) model to render features as inputs for the SVD enhancer and generate continuous, artifact-free, consistent novel views.

Schiffman"], "title": "Transformers converge to invariant algorithmic cores", "categories": ["cs.LG", "cs.AI"], "comment": null, "summary": "Large language models exhibit sophisticated capabilities, yet understanding how they work internally remains a central challenge. A fundamental obstacle is that training selects for behavior, not circuitry, so many weight configurations can implement the same function. Which internal structures reflect the computation, and which are accidents of a particular training run? This work extracts algorithmic cores: compact subspaces necessary and sufficient for task performance. Independently trained transformers learn different weights but converge to the same cores. Markov-chain transformers embed 3D cores in nearly orthogonal subspaces yet recover identical transition spectra. Modular-addition transformers discover compact cyclic operators at grokking that later inflate, yielding a predictive model of the memorization-to-generalization transition. GPT-2 language models govern subject-verb agreement through a single axis that, when flipped, inverts grammatical number throughout generation across scales. These results reveal low-dimensional invariants that persist across training runs and scales, suggesting that transformer computations are organized around compact, shared algorithmic structures. Mechanistic interpretability could benefit from targeting such invariants -- the computational essence -- rather than implementation-specific details."}

We aim to bridge understanding and generation via a new multi-modality model that provides the intelligent abilities to instruction-based image editing models for more complex cases.

However, their inherited position-dependent modeling mechanism, Rotary Position Embedding (RoPE), remains suboptimal for 3D multimodal understanding. The vanilla RoPE formulation fails to preserve essential three-dimensional spatial structures when encoding 3D tokens, and its relative distance computation overlooks angular dependencies, hindering the model's ability to capture directional variations in visual representations. To overcome these limitations, we introduce Spherical Coordinate-based Positional Embedding (SoPE). Our method maps point-cloud token indices into a 3D spherical coordinate space, enabling unified modeling of spatial locations and directional angles. This formulation preserves the inherent geometric structure of point-cloud data, enhances spatial awareness, and yields more consistent and expressive geometric representations for multimodal learning. In addition, we introduce a multi-scale frequency mixing strategy to fuse feature information across different frequency domains. Experimental results on multiple 3D scene benchmarks validate the effectiveness of our approach, while real-world deployment experiments further demonstrate its strong generalization capability."}

However, this design exposes agents to indirect prompt injection (IPI), where attacker-controlled context embedded in tool outputs or retrieved content silently steers agent actions away from user intent. Unlike prompt-based attacks, IPI unfolds over multi-turn trajectories, making malicious control difficult to disentangle from legitimate task execution. Existing inference-time defenses primarily rely on heuristic detection and conservative blocking of high-risk actions, which can prematurely terminate workflows or broadly suppress tool usage under ambiguous multi-turn scenarios. We propose AgentSentry, a novel inference-time detection and mitigation framework for tool-augmented LLM agents. To the best of our knowledge, AgentSentry is the first inference-time defense to model multi-turn IPI as a temporal causal takeover. It localizes takeover points via controlled counterfactual re-executions at tool-return boundaries and enables safe continuation through causally guided context purification that removes attack-induced deviations while preserving task-relevant evidence. We evaluate AgentSentry on the \\textsc{AgentDojo} benchmark across four task suites, three IPI attack families, and multiple black-box LLMs. AgentSentry eliminates successful attacks and maintains strong utility under attack, achieving an average Utility Under Attack (UA) of 74.55 %, improving UA by 20.8 to 33.6 percentage points over the strongest baselines without degrading benign performance."}

This framework enables a rigorous evaluation of current LLM capabilities with respect to the simulation of social media user behavior. We evaluated open-weight 8B models (Llama3.1, Qwen3, Ministral) in English, German, and Luxembourgish language scenarios.

This technical report presents a system that performs full-parameter LLM training across geo-distributed GPU clusters during regional curtailment windows, elastically switching between local single-site training and federated multi-site synchronization as sites become available or unavailable. Our prototype trains a 561M-parameter transformer model across three clusters using the Flower federated learning framework, with curtailment periods derived from real-world marginal carbon intensity traces.

Accepted to the 36th International Conference on Automated Planning and Scheduling (ICAPS 2026)", "summary": "Value decomposition (VD) methods have achieved remarkable success in cooperative multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL). However, their reliance on the max operator for temporal-difference (TD) target calculation leads to systematic Q-value overestimation. This issue is particularly severe in MARL due to the combinatorial explosion of the joint action space, which often results in unstable learning and suboptimal policies. To address this problem, we propose QSIM, a similarity weighted Q-learning framework that reconstructs the TD target using action similarity. Instead of using the greedy joint action directly, QSIM forms a similarity weighted expectation over a structured near-greedy joint action space. This formulation allows the target to integrate Q-values from diverse yet behaviorally related actions while assigning greater influence to those that are more similar to the greedy choice. By smoothing the target with structurally relevant alternatives, QSIM effectively mitigates overestimation and improves learning stability. Extensive experiments demonstrate that QSIM can be seamlessly integrated with various VD methods, consistently yielding superior performance and stability compared to the original algorithms. Furthermore, empirical analysis confirms that QSIM significantly mitigates the systematic value overestimation in MARL. Code is available at https://github.com/MaoMaoLYJ/pymarl-qsim."}

This work focuses on the problem of contributive attribution: identifying the dominant knowledge source behind each output. We show that a probe, a simple linear classifier trained on model hidden representations, can reliably predict contributive attribution. For its training, we introduce AttriWiki, a self-supervised data pipeline that prompts models to recall withheld entities from memory or read them from context, generating labelled examples automatically. Probes trained on AttriWiki data reveal a strong attribution signal, achieving up to 0.96 Macro-F1 on Llama-3.1-8B, Mistral-7B, and Qwen-7B, transferring to out-of-domain benchmarks (SQuAD, WebQuestions) with 0.94-0.99 Macro-F1 without retraining. Attribution mismatches raise error rates by up to 70%, demonstrating a direct link between knowledge source confusion and unfaithful answers. Yet, models may still respond incorrectly even when attribution is correct, highlighting the need for broader detection frameworks."}

As models scale and update across generations, prompt behavior becomes sensitive to shifts in instruction-following policies, alignment regimes, and decoding strategies, a phenomenon we characterize as GPT-scale model drift. Under such conditions, surface-level formatting conventions and ad hoc refinement are insufficient to ensure stable, interpretable control. This paper reconceptualizes Natural Language Declarative Prompting (NLD-P) as a declarative governance method rather than a rigid field template. NLD-P is formalized as a modular control abstraction that separates provenance, constraint logic, task content, and post-generation evaluation, encoded directly in natural language without reliance on external orchestration code. We define minimal compliance criteria, analyze model-dependent schema receptivity, and position NLD-P as an accessible governance framework for non-developer practitioners operating within evolving LLM ecosystems. Portions of drafting and editorial refinement employed a schema-bound LLM assistant configured under NLD-P. All conceptual framing, methodological claims, and final revisions were directed, reviewed, and approved by the human author under a documented human-in-the-loop protocol. The paper concludes by outlining implications for declarative control under ongoing model evolution and identifying directions for future empirical validation."}

To enable more fine-grained policy updates, recent research has increasingly shifted toward stepwise group-based policy optimization, which treats each step in a rollout trajectory independently while using a memory module to retain historical context. However, we find a key issue in estimating stepwise relative advantages, namely context inconsistency, where steps within the same group may differ in their historical contexts. Empirically, we reveal that this issue can lead to severely biased advantage estimation, thereby degrading policy optimization significantly. To address the issue, in this paper, we propose Hierarchy-of-Groups Policy Optimization (HGPO) for long-horizon agentic tasks. Specifically, within a group of rollout trajectories, HGPO assigns each step to multiple hierarchical groups according to the consistency of historical contexts. Then, for each step, HGPO computes distinct advantages within each group and aggregates them with an adaptive weighting scheme. In this way, HGPO can achieve a favorable bias-variance trade-off in stepwise advantage estimation, without extra models or rollouts. Evaluations on two challenging agentic tasks, ALFWorld and WebShop with Qwen2.5-1.5B-Instruct and Qwen2.5-7B-Instruct, show that HGPO significantly outperforms existing agentic RL methods under the same computational constraints.

However, due to the complex reasoning processes and substantial individual differences involved in traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) clinical diagnosis and treatment, traditional RAG methods often exhibit poor performance in this domain. Objective: To address the limitations of conventional RAG approaches in TCM applications, this study aims to develop an improved RAG framework tailored to the characteristics of TCM reasoning. Methods: We developed TCM-DiffRAG, an innovative RAG framework that integrates knowledge graphs (KG) with chains of thought (CoT). TCM-DiffRAG was evaluated on three distinctive TCM test datasets. Results: The experimental results demonstrated that TCM-DiffRAG achieved significant performance improvements over native LLMs. For example, the qwen-plus model achieved scores of 0.927, 0.361, and 0.038, which were significantly enhanced to 0.952, 0.788, and 0.356 with TCM-DiffRAG. The improvements were even more pronounced for non-Chinese LLMs. Additionally, TCM-DiffRAG outperformed directly supervised fine-tuned (SFT) LLMs and other benchmark RAG methods. Conclusions: TCM-DiffRAG shows that integrating structured TCM knowledge graphs with Chain of Thought based reasoning substantially improves performance in individualized diagnostic tasks. The joint use of universal and personalized knowledge graphs enables effective alignment between general knowledge and clinical reasoning. These results highlight the potential of reasoning-aware RAG frameworks for advancing LLM applications in traditional Chinese medicine."}

We introduce a pilot evaluation harness for directed contextual influence in trolley-problem-style moral triage: for each demographic factor, we apply matched, direction-flipped contextual influences that differ only in which group they favor, enabling systematic measurement of directional response. We find that: (i) contextual influences often significantly shift decisions, even when only superficially relevant; (ii) baseline preferences are a poor predictor of directional steerability, as models can appear baseline-neutral yet exhibit systematic steerability asymmetry under influence; (iii) influences can backfire: models may explicitly claim neutrality or discount the contextual cue, yet their choices still shift, sometimes in the opposite direction; and (iv) reasoning reduces average sensitivity, but amplifies the effect of biased few-shot examples.

For many technologies (e.g. peer-to-peer networks, IoT, multi-agent systems), extending the ability to calculate consensus rankings with guarantees in a decentralized setting, i.e., when preference data is initially distributed across a communicating network, remains a major methodological challenge. Indeed, in recent years, the literature on decentralized computation has mainly focused on computing or optimizing statistics such as arithmetic means using gossip algorithms. The purpose of this article is precisely to study how to achieve reliable consensus on collective rankings using classical rules (e.g. Borda, Copeland) in a decentralized setting, thereby raising new questions, robustness to corrupted nodes, and scalability through reduced communication costs in particular. The approach proposed and analyzed here relies on random gossip communication, allowing autonomous agents to compute global ranking consensus using only local interactions, without coordination or central authority.\n  We provide rigorous convergence guarantees, including explicit rate bounds, for the Borda and Copeland consensus methods. Beyond these rules, we also provide a decentralized implementation of consensus according to the median rank rule and local Kemenization. Extensive empirical evaluations on various network topologies and real and synthetic ranking datasets demonstrate that our algorithms converge quickly and reliably to the correct ranking aggregation."}

Our investigation demonstrates that MEDNA-DFM effectively captures conserved methylation patterns, achieving robust distinction across diverse species. Validation on external independent datasets confirms that the model's generalization is driven by conserved intrinsic motifs (e.g., GC content) rather than phylogenetic proximity. Furthermore, applying our developed algorithms extracted motifs with significantly higher reliability than prior studies.

Given a problem, we (i) sample many diverse, low-cost reasoning trajectories using a masked diffusion language model, (ii) score every intermediate step with an off-the-shelf process reward model (PRM), and (iii) stitch these highest-quality steps across trajectories into a composite rationale. This rationale then conditions an autoregressive (AR) model (solver) to recompute only the final answer. This modular pipeline separates exploration (diffusion) from evaluation and solution synthesis, avoiding monolithic unified hybrids while preserving broad search. Across math reasoning benchmarks, we find that step-level recombination is most beneficial on harder problems, and ablations highlight the importance of the final AR solver in converting stitched but imperfect rationales into accurate answers. Using low-confidence diffusion sampling with parallel, independent rollouts, our training-free framework improves average accuracy by up to 23.8% across six math and coding tasks.

Mainstream Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) and Speaker Diarization systems for Bangla struggles when processing longform audio exceeding 3060 seconds. This paper presents a robust framework specifically engineered for extended Bangla content by leveraging preexisting models enhanced with novel optimization pipelines for the DL Sprint 4.0 contest. Our approach utilizes Voice Activity Detection (VAD) optimization and Connectionist Temporal Classification (CTC) segmentation via forced word alignment to maintain temporal accuracy and transcription integrity over long durations. Additionally, we employed several finetuning techniques and preprocessed the data using augmentation techniques and noise removal.

Typically, prompt tuning techniques have harnessed knowledge from a single pre-trained model, whether from a general or a specialized medical domain. However, this approach typically overlooks the potential synergies that could arise from integrating diverse domain knowledge within the same tuning process. In this work, we propose a novel Mixture-of-Experts prompt tuning method called pMoE, which leverages the strengths of multiple expert domains through expert-specialized prompt tokens and the learnable dispatcher, effectively combining their expertise in a unified model framework. Our pMoE introduces expert-specific prompt tokens and utilizes a dynamic token dispatching mechanism at various prompt layers to optimize the contribution of each domain expert during the adaptation phase. By incorporating both domain knowledge from diverse experts, the proposed pMoE significantly enhances the model's versatility and applicability to a broad spectrum of tasks. We conduct extensive experiments across 47 adaptation tasks, including both classification and segmentation in general and medical domains. The results demonstrate that our pMoE not only achieves superior performance with a large margin of improvements but also offers an optimal trade-off between computational efficiency and adaptation effectiveness compared to existing methods."}

They therefore need an expected probability of failure for a transformer before training starts. Our study of Residual Koopman Spectral Profiling (RKSP) provides such an estimate. From a single forward pass at initialization, RKSP extracts Koopman spectral features by applying whitened dynamic mode decomposition to layer-wise residual snapshots. Our central diagnostic, the near-unit spectral mass, quantifies the fraction of modes concentrated near the unit circle, which captures instability risk. For predicting divergence across extensive configurations, this estimator achieves an AUROC of 0.995, outperforming the best gradient baseline. We further make this diagnostic actionable through Koopman Spectral Shaping (KSS), which reshapes spectra during training. We empirically validate that our method works in practice: RKSP predicts divergence at initialization, and when RKSP flags high risk, turning on KSS successfully prevents divergence. In the challenging high learning rate regime without normalization layers, KSS reduces the divergence rate from 66.7% to 12.5% and enables learning rates that are 50% to 150% higher.

One open problem that remains to be solved by a new generation of hearing aids is the cocktail party problem. A possible solution is electroencephalography-based auditory attention decoding. This has been the subject of several studies in recent years, which have in common that they use the same preprocessing methods in most cases. In this work, in order to achieve an advantage, the use of a scattering transform is proposed as an alternative to these preprocessing methods. The two-layer scattering transform is compared with a regular filterbank, the synchrosqueezing short-time Fourier transform and the common preprocessing. To demonstrate the performance, the known and the proposed preprocessing methods are compared for different classification tasks on two widely used datasets, provided by the KU Leuven (KUL) and the Technical University of Denmark (DTU). Both established and new neural-network-based models, CNNs, LSTMs, and recent Transformer/graph-based models are used for classification. Various evaluation strategies were compared, with a focus on the task of classifying speakers who are unknown from the training. We show that the two-layer scattering transform can significantly improve the performance for subject-related conditions, especially on the KUL dataset. However, on the DTU dataset, this only applies to some of the models, or when larger amounts of training data are provided, as in 10-fold cross-validation. This suggests that the scattering transform is capable of extracting additional relevant information."}

Modern deployments increasingly integrate diverse accelerators and near-memory processing technologies, introducing significant hardware heterogeneity, while system software increasingly separates computation, memory, and model components across distributed resources to improve scalability and efficiency. As a result, LLM serving performance is no longer determined by hardware or software choices in isolation, but by their runtime interaction through scheduling, data movement, and interconnect behavior. However, understanding these interactions remains challenging, as existing simulators lack the ability to jointly model heterogeneous hardware and disaggregated serving techniques within a unified, runtime-driven framework.\n  This paper presents LLMServingSim 2.0, a unified system-level simulator designed to make runtime-driven hardware-software interactions in heterogeneous and disaggregated LLM serving infrastructures explicit and analyzable. LLMServingSim 2.0 embeds serving decisions and hardware behavior into a single runtime loop, enabling interaction-aware modeling of batching, routing, offloading, memory, and power. The simulator supports extensible integration of emerging accelerators and memory systems through profile-based modeling, while capturing dynamic serving behavior and system-level effects. We validate LLMServingSim 2.0 against real deployments, showing that it reproduces key performance, memory, and power metrics with an average error of 0.97%, while maintaining simulation times of around 10 minutes even for complex configurations.

We propose Affine-Scaled Attention, a simple extension to standard attention that introduces input-dependent scaling and a corresponding bias term applied to softmax-normalized attention weights. This design relaxes the strict normalization constraint while maintaining aggregation of value representations, allowing the model to adjust both the relative distribution and the scale of attention in a controlled manner.\n  We empirically evaluate Affine-Scaled Attention in large-scale language model pretraining across multiple model sizes. Experimental results show consistent improvements in training stability, optimization behavior, and downstream task performance compared to standard softmax attention and attention sink baselines.

These documents are widely observed across domains and account for a large portion of real-world data. However, existing methods struggle to support natural language question answering over these documents due to three main technical challenges: (1) The elements extracted by techniques like OCR are often fragmented and stripped of their original semantic context, making them inadequate for analysis. (2) Existing approaches lack effective representations to capture hierarchical structures within documents (e.g., associating tables with nested chapter titles) and to preserve layout-specific distinctions (e.g., differentiating sidebars from main content). (3) Answering questions often requires retrieving and aligning relevant information scattered across multiple regions or pages, such as linking a descriptive paragraph to table cells located elsewhere in the document.\n  To address these issues, we propose MoDora, an LLM-powered system for semi-structured document analysis. First, we adopt a local-alignment aggregation strategy to convert OCR-parsed elements into layout-aware components, and conduct type-specific information extraction for components with hierarchical titles or non-text elements. Second, we design the Component-Correlation Tree (CCTree) to hierarchically organize components, explicitly modeling inter-component relations and layout distinctions through a bottom-up cascade summarization process. Finally, we propose a question-type-aware retrieval strategy that supports (1) layout-based grid partitioning for location-based retrieval and (2) LLM-guided pruning for semantic-based retrieval.

In this paper, detailing our submission to the DL Sprint 4.0 competition, we systematically evaluate various architectures and approaches for long-form Bengali speech. For ASR, we demonstrate that raw data scaling is ineffective; instead, targeted fine-tuning utilizing perfectly aligned annotations paired with synthetic acoustic degradation (noise and reverberation) emerges as the singular most effective approach. Conversely, for speaker diarization, we observed that global open-source state-of-the-art models (such as Diarizen) performed surprisingly poorly on this complex dataset. Extensive model retraining yielded negligible improvements; instead, strategic, heuristic post-processing of baseline model outputs proved to be the primary driver for increasing accuracy.

By integrating C-ToBI boundary annotation with Dependency Grammar analysis, we examined both the quantity of prosodic boundaries and their mapping to syntactic relations. Results reveal a non-linear acquisition: although high-proficiency learners (VNH) converge to the native baseline in boundary quantity at the Major Phrase level (B3), their structural mapping significantly diverges. Specifically, VNH demote the prosodic boundary at the Subject-Verb (SBV) interface (Major Phrase B3 -> Prosodic Word B1), while erroneously promoting the boundary at the Verb-Object (VOB) interface (Prosodic Word B1 -> Major Phrase B3). This strategy allows learners to maintain high long phrasal output at the expense of structural accuracy. This results in a distorted prosodic hierarchy where the native pattern is inverted."}

The formal framework for such problems is the partially observable Markov decision process (POMDP), where risk sensitivity is introduced through a risk measure applied to the value function, with Conditional Value-at-Risk (CVaR) being a particularly significant criterion. However, solving POMDPs is computationally intractable in general, and approximate methods rely on computationally expensive simulations of future agent trajectories. This work introduces a theoretical framework for accelerating CVaR value function evaluation in POMDPs with formal performance guarantees. We derive new bounds on the CVaR of a random variable X using an auxiliary random variable Y, under assumptions relating their cumulative distribution and density functions; these bounds yield interpretable concentration inequalities and converge as the distributional discrepancy vanishes. Building on this, we establish upper and lower bounds on the CVaR value function computable from a simplified belief-MDP, accommodating general simplifications of the transition dynamics. We develop estimators for these bounds within a particle-belief MDP framework with probabilistic guarantees, and employ them for acceleration via action elimination: actions whose bounds indicate suboptimality under the simplified model are safely discarded while ensuring consistency with the original POMDP. Empirical evaluation across multiple POMDP domains confirms that the bounds reliably separate safe from dangerous policies while achieving substantial computational speedups under the simplified model."}

The decoder has no learned use for these directions; their presence is noise.\n  We formalize this as a mismatched decoder problem: a decoder trained on text can only extract information along text-aligned directions. Accessible information is bounded by the Generalized Mutual Information (GMI), with degradation scaling with distributional distance and decoder sensitivity. The bound is a property of the decoder's scoring rule, not of any particular architecture; it applies whether non-text inputs arrive through a learned projection, a discrete codebook, or no explicit adapter at all. We validate this across five models spanning speech and vision. A controlled experiment (two Prismatic VLMs differing only in encoder text-alignment) confirms the bottleneck is the decoder's scoring rule, not the encoder or projection.

To this end, we propose ColoDiff, a diffusion-based framework that generates dynamic-consistent and content-aware colonoscopy videos, aiming to alleviate data shortage and assist clinical analysis. At the inter-frame level, our TimeStream module decouples temporal dependency from video sequences through a cross-frame tokenization mechanism, enabling intricate dynamic modeling despite irregular intestinal structures. At the intra-frame level, our Content-Aware module incorporates noise-injected embeddings and learnable prototypes to realize precise control over clinical attributes, breaking through the coarse guidance of diffusion models. Additionally, ColoDiff employs a non-Markovian sampling strategy that cuts steps by over 90% for real-time generation. ColoDiff is evaluated across three public datasets and one hospital database, based on both generation metrics and downstream tasks including disease diagnosis, modality discrimination, bowel preparation scoring, and lesion segmentation. Extensive experiments show ColoDiff generates videos with smooth transitions and rich dynamics. ColoDiff presents an effort in controllable colonoscopy video generation, revealing the potential of synthetic videos in complementing authentic representation and mitigating data scarcity in clinical settings."}

In contrast, genuinely non-AR generation is promising because it removes AR's sequential bottleneck, better exploiting parallel hardware to reduce synchronization/communication overhead and improve latency scaling with output length. We argue that a primary driver of AR-like decoding is a mismatch between DLM objectives and the highly sequential structure of widely used training data, including standard pretraining corpora and long chain-of-thought (CoT) supervision. Motivated by this diagnosis, we propose NAP (Non-Autoregressive Parallel DLMs), a proof-of-concept, data-centric approach that better aligns supervision with non-AR parallel decoding. NAP curates examples as multiple independent reasoning trajectories and couples them with a parallel-forced decoding strategy that encourages multi-token parallel updates. Across math reasoning benchmarks, NAP yields stronger performance under parallel decoding than DLMs trained on standard long CoT data, with gains growing as parallelism increases. Our results suggest that revisiting data and supervision is a principled direction for mitigating AR-like behavior and moving toward genuinely non-autoregressive parallel generation in DLMs. Our code is available at https://github.com/pixeli99/NAP."}

Automatic synopsis generation for long-form videos, such as movies and TV series, presents a significant challenge for existing Vision-Language Models (VLMs). While proficient at single-image captioning, these general-purpose models often exhibit critical failures in long-duration contexts, primarily a lack of ID-consistent character identification and a fractured narrative coherence. To overcome these limitations, we propose MovieTeller, a novel framework for generating movie synopses via tool-augmented progressive abstraction. Our core contribution is a training-free, tool-augmented, fact-grounded generation process. Instead of requiring costly model fine-tuning, our framework directly leverages off-the-shelf models in a plug-and-play manner. We first invoke a specialized face recognition model as an external \"tool\" to establish Factual Groundings--precise character identities and their corresponding bounding boxes. These groundings are then injected into the prompt to steer the VLM's reasoning, ensuring the generated scene descriptions are anchored to verifiable facts. Furthermore, our progressive abstraction pipeline decomposes the summarization of a full-length movie into a multi-stage process, effectively mitigating the context length limitations of current VLMs. Experiments demonstrate that our approach yields significant improvements in factual accuracy, character consistency, and overall narrative coherence compared to end-to-end baselines."}

To maximize relevance, we leverage two complementary objectives: behavioral relevance (results users tend to click or download) and textual relevance (a result's semantic fit to the query). A persistent challenge is the scarcity of expert-provided textual relevance labels relative to abundant behavioral relevance labels. We first address this by systematically evaluating LLM configurations, finding that a specialized, fine-tuned model significantly outperforms a much larger pre-trained one in providing highly relevant labels. Using this optimal model as a force multiplier, we generate millions of textual relevance labels to overcome the data scarcity. We show that augmenting our production ranker with these textual relevance labels leads to a significant outward shift of the Pareto frontier: offline NDCG improves for behavioral relevance while simultaneously increasing for textual relevance. These offline gains were validated by a worldwide A/B test on the App Store ranker, which demonstrated a statistically significant +0.24% increase in conversion rate, with the most substantial performance gains occurring in tail queries, where the new textual relevance labels provide a robust signal in the absence of reliable behavioral relevance labels."}

We identify two critical misalignments in existing compression paradigms: the temporal mismatch, where uniform history encoding diverges from the agent's \"fading memory\" attention pattern, and the spatial topology conflict, where unstructured pruning compromises the grid integrity required for precise coordinate grounding, inducing spatial hallucinations. To address these challenges, we introduce GUIPruner, a training-free framework tailored for high-resolution GUI navigation. It synergizes Temporal-Adaptive Resolution (TAR), which eliminates historical redundancy via decay-based resizing, and Stratified Structure-aware Pruning (SSP), which prioritizes interactive foregrounds and semantic anchors while safeguarding global layout. Extensive evaluations across diverse benchmarks demonstrate that GUIPruner consistently achieves state-of-the-art performance, effectively preventing the collapse observed in large-scale models under high compression. Notably, on Qwen2-VL-2B, our method delivers a 3.4x reduction in FLOPs and a 3.3x speedup in vision encoding latency while retaining over 94% of the original performance, enabling real-time, high-precision navigation with minimal resource consumption."}

Currently, IL-based methods have become a mainstream paradigm: models rely on standard driving behaviors given by experts, and learn to minimize the discrepancy between their actions and expert actions. However, this objective of \"only driving like the expert\" suffers from limited generalization: when encountering rare or unseen long-tail scenarios outside the distribution of expert demonstrations, models tend to produce unsafe decisions in the absence of prior experience. This raises a fundamental question: Can an E2E-AD system make reliable decisions without any expert action supervision? Motivated by this, we propose a unified framework named Risk-aware World Model Predictive Control (RaWMPC) to address this generalization dilemma through robust control, without reliance on expert demonstrations. Practically, RaWMPC leverages a world model to predict the consequences of multiple candidate actions and selects low-risk actions through explicit risk evaluation. To endow the world model with the ability to predict the outcomes of risky driving behaviors, we design a risk-aware interaction strategy that systematically exposes the world model to hazardous behaviors, making catastrophic outcomes predictable and thus avoidable. Furthermore, to generate low-risk candidate actions at test time, we introduce a self-evaluation distillation method to distill riskavoidance capabilities from the well-trained world model into a generative action proposal network without any expert demonstration. Extensive experiments show that RaWMPC outperforms state-of-the-art methods in both in-distribution and out-of-distribution scenarios, while providing superior decision interpretability."}

Yet existing benchmarks are small, manually curated - and therefore error-prone - and contain shallow questions that seldom demand more than two hops or invoke aggregations, grouping, or other advanced analytical operations expressible in natural-language queries. We present SPARTA, an end-to-end construction framework that automatically generates large-scale Table-Text QA benchmarks with lightweight human validation, requiring only one quarter of the annotation time of HybridQA. The framework first constructs a reference fact database by enriching each source table with grounding tables whose tuples are atomic facts automatically extracted from the accompanying unstructured passages, then synthesizes nested queries whose number of nested predicates matches the desired hop count. To ensure that every SQL statement is executable and that its verbalization yields a fluent, human-sounding question, we propose two novel techniques: provenance-based refinement, which rewrites any syntactically valid query that returns a non-empty result, and realistic-structure enforcement, which confines generation to post-order traversals of the query graph. The resulting pipeline produces thousands of high-fidelity question-answer pairs covering aggregations, grouping, and deep multi-hop reasoning across text and tables. On SPARTA, state-of-the-art models that reach over 70 F1 on HybridQA or over 50 F1 on OTT-QA drop by more than 30 F1 points, exposing fundamental weaknesses in current cross-modal reasoning.

Without reliable UQ, FL systems risk deploying overconfident models at under-resourced agents, leading to silent local failures despite seemingly satisfactory global performance. Existing federated UQ approaches often address data heterogeneity or model heterogeneity in isolation, overlooking their joint effect on coverage reliability across agents. Conformal prediction is a widely used distribution-free UQ framework, yet its applications in heterogeneous FL settings remains underexplored. We provide FedWQ-CP, a simple yet effective approach that balances empirical coverage performance with efficiency at both global and agent levels under the dual heterogeneity. FedWQ-CP performs agent-server calibration in a single communication round. On each agent, conformity scores are computed on calibration data and a local quantile threshold is derived. Each agent then transmits only its quantile threshold and calibration sample size to the server. The server simply aggregates these thresholds through a weighted average to produce a global threshold. Experimental results on seven public datasets for both classification and regression demonstrate that FedWQ-CP empirically maintains agent-wise and global coverage while producing the smallest prediction sets or intervals."}

Yet, assigning roles in real time remains challenging for resource-constrained mobile and assistive robots. While large language models (LLMs) have shown promise for natural communication, their size and latency limit on-device deployment. Small language models (SLMs) offer a potential alternative, but their effectiveness for role classification in HRI has not been systematically evaluated. In this paper, we present a benchmark of SLMs for leader-follower communication, introducing a novel dataset derived from a published database and augmented with synthetic samples to capture interaction-specific dynamics. We investigate two adaptation strategies: prompt engineering and fine-tuning, studied under zero-shot and one-shot interaction modes, compared with an untrained baseline. Experiments with Qwen2.5-0.5B reveal that zero-shot fine-tuning achieves robust classification performance (86.66% accuracy) while maintaining low latency (22.2 ms per sample), significantly outperforming baseline and prompt-engineered approaches. However, results also indicate a performance degradation in one-shot modes, where increased context length challenges the model's architectural capacity. These findings demonstrate that fine-tuned SLMs provide an effective solution for direct role assignment, while highlighting critical trade-offs between dialogue complexity and classification reliability on the edge."}

We introduce a semi-supervised setting in which pretrained unimodal encoders are aligned using a small number of image-text pairs together with large amounts of unpaired data. To address this challenge, we propose SOTAlign, a two-stage framework that first recovers a coarse shared geometry from limited paired data using a linear teacher, then refines the alignment on unpaired samples via an optimal-transport-based divergence that transfers relational structure without overconstraining the target space. Unlike existing semi-supervised methods, SOTAlign effectively leverages unpaired images and text, learning robust joint embeddings across datasets and encoder pairs, and significantly outperforming supervised and semi-supervised baselines."}

It is essential for synthesizing partially occluded objects with depth-consistent geometry and scale. While existing methods can generate realistic scenes that follow input layouts, they often fail to model precise inter-object occlusions. We propose SeeThrough3D, a model for 3D layout conditioned generation that explicitly models occlusions. We introduce an occlusion-aware 3D scene representation (OSCR), where objects are depicted as translucent 3D boxes placed within a virtual environment and rendered from desired camera viewpoint. The transparency encodes hidden object regions, enabling the model to reason about occlusions, while the rendered viewpoint provides explicit camera control during generation. We condition a pretrained flow based text-to-image image generation model by introducing a set of visual tokens derived from our rendered 3D representation. Furthermore, we apply masked self-attention to accurately bind each object bounding box to its corresponding textual description, enabling accurate generation of multiple objects without object attribute mixing. To train the model, we construct a synthetic dataset with diverse multi-object scenes with strong inter-object occlusions. SeeThrough3D generalizes effectively to unseen object categories and enables precise 3D layout control with realistic occlusions and consistent camera control."}
