Commercial Large Language Models (LLMs), such as ChatGPT and\nDeepSeek, require substantial resources, while the utilization of these systems\nfor medical purposes raises critical issues regarding patient privacy and\nsafety. Methods We developed a customizable Retrieval-Augmented Generation\n(RAG) framework for medical tasks, which monitors its energy usage and CO2\nemissions. This system was then used to create RAGs based on various\nopen-source LLMs. The tested models included both general purpose models like\nllama3.1:8b and medgemma-4b-it, which is medical-domain specific. The best RAGs\nperformance and energy consumption was compared to DeepSeekV3-R1 and OpenAIs\no4-mini model. A dataset of medical questions was used for the evaluation.\nResults Custom RAG models outperformed commercial models in accuracy and energy\nconsumption. The RAG model built on llama3.1:8B achieved the highest accuracy\n(58.5%) and was significantly better than other models, including o4-mini and\nDeepSeekV3-R1. The llama3.1-RAG also exhibited the lowest energy consumption\nand CO2 footprint among all models, with a Performance per kWh of 0.52 and a\ntotal CO2 emission of 473g. Compared to o4-mini, the llama3.1-RAG achieved 2.7x\ntimes more accuracy points per kWh and 172% less electricity usage while\nmaintaining higher accuracy.

While\nadaptive keyframe extraction mitigates transmission overhead, existing\napproaches often overlook the causal relationships among allocated bandwidth,\nCPU frequency, and user perception, limiting QoE gains. This paper proposes an\nintelligent framework to maximize QoE by integrating adaptive keyframe\nextraction with causal-aware reinforcement learning (RL). First, a novel QoE\nmetric is formulated using the Weber-Fechner Law, combining perceptual\nsensitivity, attention-driven priorities, and motion reconstruction accuracy.\nThe QoE optimization problem is then modeled as a mixed integer programming\n(MIP) task, jointly optimizing keyframe ratios, bandwidth, and computational\nresources under horizon-fairness constraints. We propose Partial State Causal\nDeep Deterministic Policy Gradient (PS-CDDPG), which integrates the Deep\nDeterministic Policy Gradient (DDPG) method with causal influence detection. By\nleveraging causal information regarding how QoE is influenced and determined by\nvarious actions, we explore actions guided by weights calculated from causal\ninference (CI), which in turn improves training efficiency.

COIN estimates the empirical\nerror rate on a calibration set and applies confidence interval methods such as\nClopper-Pearson to establish a high-probability upper bound on the true error\nrate (i.e., FDR). This enables the selection of the largest uncertainty\nthreshold that ensures FDR control on test data while significantly increasing\nsample retention. We demonstrate COIN's robustness in risk control, strong\ntest-time power in retaining admissible answers, and predictive efficiency\nunder limited calibration data across both general and multimodal text\ngeneration tasks. Furthermore, we show that employing alternative upper bound\nconstructions and UQ strategies can further boost COIN's power performance,\nwhich underscores its extensibility and adaptability to diverse application\nscenarios."}

In this work, we formalise the problem of\nproviding recourse under MM, which we name recourse-aware ensembling (RAE). We\npropose the idea that under MM, CEs for each individual model should be\nconsidered alongside their predictions so that the aggregated prediction and\nrecourse are decided in tandem.

Despite promising results\nwere achieved, most existing methods do not sufficiently explore the scene\nevolution within an event temporal proposal for captioning, and therefore\nperform less satisfactorily when the scenes and objects change over a\nrelatively long proposal. To address this problem, we propose a graph-based\npartition-and-summarization (GPaS) framework for dense video captioning within\ntwo stages. For the ``partition\" stage, a whole event proposal is split into\nshort video segments for captioning at a finer level. For the ``summarization\"\nstage, the generated sentences carrying rich description information for each\nsegment are summarized into one sentence to describe the whole event. We\nparticularly focus on the ``summarization\" stage, and propose a framework that\neffectively exploits the relationship between semantic words for summarization.\nWe achieve this goal by treating semantic words as nodes in a graph and\nlearning their interactions by coupling Graph Convolutional Network (GCN) and\nLong Short Term Memory (LSTM), with the aid of visual cues. Two schemes of\nGCN-LSTM Interaction (GLI) modules are proposed for seamless integration of GCN\nand LSTM. The effectiveness of our approach is demonstrated via an extensive\ncomparison with the state-of-the-arts methods on the two benchmarks ActivityNet\nCaptions dataset and YouCook II dataset."}

While standalone chat-based LLMs often\nproduce suboptimal writing outcomes, evidence suggests that purposefully\ndesigned AI writing support tools can enhance the writing process. This paper\ninvestigates how different AI support approaches affect writers' sense of\nagency and depth of knowledge transformation. Through a randomized control\ntrial with 90 undergraduate students, we compare three conditions: (1) a\nchat-based LLM writing assistant, (2) an integrated AI writing tool to support\ndiverse subprocesses, and (3) a standard writing interface (control). Our\nfindings demonstrate that, among AI-supported conditions, students using the\nintegrated AI writing tool exhibited greater agency over their writing process\nand engaged in deeper knowledge transformation overall. These results suggest\nthat thoughtfully designed AI writing support targeting specific aspects of the\nwriting process can help students maintain ownership of their work while\nfacilitating improved engagement with content."}

Timely and accurate information for law\nenforcement agencies is crucial in mitigating these incidents. Current\ncommercial gunshot detection systems, while effective, often come with\nprohibitive costs. This research explores a cost-effective alternative by\nleveraging acoustic analysis of gunshot recordings, potentially obtainable from\nubiquitous devices like cell phones, to not only detect gunshots but also\nclassify the type of firearm used. This paper details a study on deciphering\ngun type hierarchies using a curated dataset of 3459 recordings. We investigate\nthe fundamental acoustic characteristics of gunshots, including muzzle blasts\nand shockwaves, which vary based on firearm type, ammunition, and shooting\ndirection. We propose and evaluate machine learning frameworks, including\nSupport Vector Machines (SVMs) as a baseline and a more advanced Convolutional\nNeural Network (CNN) architecture for joint gunshot detection and gun type\nclassification. Results indicate that our deep learning approach achieves a\nmean average precision (mAP) of 0.58 on clean labeled data, outperforming the\nSVM baseline (mAP 0.39). Challenges related to data quality, environmental\nnoise, and the generalization capabilities when using noisy web-sourced data\n(mAP 0.35) are also discussed. The long-term vision is to develop a highly\naccurate, real-time system deployable on common recording devices,\nsignificantly reducing detection costs and providing critical intelligence to\nfirst responders."}

However, the lack of resolution and the presence of noise in\nthese biomarkers are significant issues. As indicated by recent studies, it\nappears that biomarkers such as wall shear stress are particularly impacted by\nthe poor resolution of vessel segmentation. The Phase Contrast Magnetic\nResonance Angiography (PC-MRA) is the state-of-the-art method to facilitate\nsegmentation. The objective of this work is to introduce a new handcraft\nfeature that provides a novel visualisation of 4D Flow MRI images, which is\nuseful in the segmentation task. This feature, termed Weighted Mean Frequencies\n(WMF), is capable of revealing the region in three dimensions where a voxel has\nbeen passed by pulsatile flow. Indeed, this feature is representative of the\nhull of all pulsatile velocity voxels. The value of the feature under\ndiscussion is illustrated by two experiments. The experiments involved\nsegmenting 4D Flow MRI images using optimal thresholding and deep learning\nmethods. The results obtained demonstrate a substantial enhancement in terms of\nIoU and Dice, with a respective increase of 0.12 and 0.13 in comparison with\nthe PC-MRA feature, as evidenced by the deep learning task. This feature has\nthe potential to yield valuable insights that could inform future segmentation\nprocesses in other vascular regions, such as the heart or the brain."}

Traditional\nideation methods like Lean Inception lack structured support for these ML\nconsiderations, which can result in misaligned product visions and unrealistic\nexpectations. [Goal] This paper presents Define-ML, a framework that extends\nLean Inception with tailored activities - Data Source Mapping, Feature-to-Data\nSource Mapping, and ML Mapping - to systematically integrate data and technical\nconstraints into early-stage ML product ideation. [Method] We developed and\nvalidated Define-ML following the Technology Transfer Model, conducting both\nstatic validation (with a toy problem) and dynamic validation (in a real-world\nindustrial case study). The analysis combined quantitative surveys with\nqualitative feedback, assessing utility, ease of use, and intent of adoption.\n[Results] Participants found Define-ML effective for clarifying data concerns,\naligning ML capabilities with business goals, and fostering cross-functional\ncollaboration. The approach's structured activities reduced ideation ambiguity,\nthough some noted a learning curve for ML-specific components, which can be\nmitigated by expert facilitation.

These value trade-offs are an\nintegral part of human decision-making and language use, however, current tools\nfor interpreting such dynamic and multi-faceted notions of values in LLMs are\nlimited. In cognitive science, so-called \"cognitive models\" provide formal\naccounts of these trade-offs in humans, by modeling the weighting of a\nspeaker's competing utility functions in choosing an action or utterance. In\nthis work, we use a leading cognitive model of polite speech to interpret the\nextent to which LLMs represent human-like trade-offs. We apply this lens to\nsystematically evaluate value trade-offs in two encompassing model settings:\ndegrees of reasoning \"effort\" in frontier black-box models, and RL\npost-training dynamics of open-source models. Our results highlight patterns of\nhigher informational utility than social utility in reasoning models, and in\nopen-source models shown to be stronger in mathematical reasoning. Our findings\nfrom LLMs' training dynamics suggest large shifts in utility values early on in\ntraining with persistent effects of the choice of base model and pretraining\ndata, compared to feedback dataset or alignment method. We show that our method\nis responsive to diverse aspects of the rapidly evolving LLM landscape, with\ninsights for forming hypotheses about other high-level behaviors, shaping\ntraining regimes for reasoning models, and better controlling trade-offs\nbetween values during model training."}
