We propose the Adaptive Intervention\nMechanism (AIM), a novel robot-gated IIL algorithm that learns an adaptive\ncriterion for requesting human demonstrations. AIM utilizes a proxy Q-function\nto mimic the human intervention rule and adjusts intervention requests based on\nthe alignment between agent and human actions. By assigning high Q-values when\nthe agent deviates from the expert and decreasing these values as the agent\nbecomes proficient, the proxy Q-function enables the agent to assess the\nreal-time alignment with the expert and request assistance when needed. Our\nexpert-in-the-loop experiments reveal that AIM significantly reduces expert\nmonitoring efforts in both continuous and discrete control tasks. Compared to\nthe uncertainty-based baseline Thrifty-DAgger, our method achieves a 40%\nimprovement in terms of human take-over cost and learning efficiency.\nFurthermore, AIM effectively identifies safety-critical states for expert\nassistance, thereby collecting higher-quality expert demonstrations and\nreducing overall expert data and environment interactions needed.

Current methods\nfor increasing diversity often only operate at the token-level, paraphrasing\nthe same response. This is problematic because it leads to poor exploration on\nreasoning problems and to unengaging, repetitive conversational agents. To\naddress this we propose Intent Factored Generation (IFG), factorising the\nsampling process into two stages. First, we sample a semantically dense intent,\ne.g., a summary or keywords. Second, we sample the final response conditioning\non both the original prompt and the intent from the first stage. This allows us\nto use a higher temperature during the intent step to promote conceptual\ndiversity, and a lower temperature during the final generation to ensure the\noutputs are coherent and self-consistent. Additionally, we find that prompting\nthe model to explicitly state its intent for each step of the chain-of-thought\nbefore generating the step is beneficial for reasoning tasks. We demonstrate\nour method's effectiveness across a diverse set of tasks. We show this method\nimproves both pass@k and Reinforcement Learning from Verifier Feedback on maths\nand code tasks. For instruction-tuning, we combine IFG with Direct Preference\nOptimisation to increase conversational diversity without sacrificing reward.\nFinally, we achieve higher diversity while maintaining the quality of\ngenerations on a general language modelling task, using a new dataset of reader\ncomments and news articles that we collect and open-source.

Our benchmarks compare MetaTT with LoRA along with recent\nstate-of-the-art matrix and tensor decomposition based fine-tuning schemes. We\nobserve that when tested on standard language modeling benchmarks, MetaTT leads\nto the most reduction in the parameters while maintaining similar accuracy to\nLoRA and even outperforming other tensor-based methods. Unlike CP or other\nrank-factorizations, the TT ansatz benefits from mature optimization routines\n-- e.g., DMRG-style rank adaptive minimization in addition to Adam, which we\nfind simplifies training. Because new modes can be appended cheaply, MetaTT\nnaturally extends to shared adapters across many tasks without redesigning the\ncore tensor."}

Extensive system-level simulations\nover a 24-hour period show that our framework significantly reduces the\nproportion of unsatisfied UEs during peak hours and achieves up to 19%\nthroughput gains and 5% energy savings in low-traffic periods, outperforming\nstandard network settings following 3GPP recommendations."}

We\nfind that spatial proximity governs which aspects of a maze are available for\nplanning, and that when task-relevant information follows natural (lateralised)\ncontours of attention, people can more easily construct simplified and useful\nmaze representations. This influence of attention varies considerably across\nindividuals, explaining differences in people's task representations and\nbehaviour.

Therefore, we\npropose ELBO-T2IAlign, a simple yet effective method to calibrate pixel-text\nalignment in diffusion models based on the evidence lower bound (ELBO) of\nlikelihood. Our method is training-free and generic, eliminating the need to\nidentify the specific cause of misalignment and works well across various\ndiffusion model architectures. Extensive experiments on commonly used benchmark\ndatasets on image segmentation and generation have verified the effectiveness\nof our proposed calibration approach."}

Preliminary studies observe that the hidden activations of LLMs\noften resemble English, even when responding to non-English prompts. This has\nled to the widespread assumption that LLMs may \"think\" in English. However,\nmore recent results showing strong multilingual performance, even surpassing\nEnglish performance on specific tasks in other languages, challenge this view.\nIn this work, we find that LLMs progressively develop a core language-agnostic\nparameter space-a remarkably small subset of parameters whose deactivation\nresults in significant performance degradation across all languages. This\ncompact yet critical set of parameters underlies the model's ability to\ngeneralize beyond individual languages, supporting the emergence of abstract\nthought that is not tied to any specific linguistic system. Specifically, we\nidentify language-related neurons-those are consistently activated during the\nprocessing of particular languages, and categorize them as either shared\n(active across multiple languages) or exclusive (specific to one). As LLMs\nundergo continued development over time, we observe a marked increase in both\nthe proportion and functional importance of shared neurons, while exclusive\nneurons progressively diminish in influence. These shared neurons constitute\nthe backbone of the core language-agnostic parameter space, supporting the\nemergence of abstract thought. Motivated by these insights, we propose\nneuron-specific training strategies tailored to LLMs' language-agnostic levels\nat different development stages.

Developing a feed-forward model for dynamic scene\nreconstruction poses significant challenges, including the scarcity of training\ndata and the need for appropriate 3D representations and training paradigms. To\naddress these challenges, we introduce several key technical contributions: an\nenhanced large-scale synthetic dataset with ground-truth multi-view videos and\ndense 3D scene flow supervision; a per-pixel deformable 3D Gaussian\nrepresentation that is easy to learn, supports high-quality dynamic view\nsynthesis, and enables long-range 3D tracking; and a large transformer network\nthat achieves real-time, generalizable dynamic scene reconstruction. Extensive\nqualitative and quantitative experiments demonstrate that DGS-LRM achieves\ndynamic scene reconstruction quality comparable to optimization-based methods,\nwhile significantly outperforming the state-of-the-art predictive dynamic\nreconstruction method on real-world examples. Its predicted physically grounded\n3D deformation is accurate and can readily adapt for long-range 3D tracking\ntasks, achieving performance on par with state-of-the-art monocular video 3D\ntracking methods."}
