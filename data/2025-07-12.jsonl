In this work, we\nintroduce a unified agentic framework that leverages large language models\n(LLMs) for both discrete fault-recovery planning and continuous process control\nwithin a single architecture. We adopt Finite State Machines (FSMs) as\ninterpretable operating envelopes: an LLM-driven planning agent proposes\nrecovery sequences through the FSM, a Simulation Agent executes and checks each\ntransition, and a Validator-Reprompting loop iteratively refines invalid plans.\nIn Case Study 1, across 180 randomly generated FSMs of varying sizes (4-25\nstates, 4-300 transitions), GPT-4o and GPT-4o-mini achieve 100% valid-path\nsuccess within five reprompts-outperforming open-source LLMs in both accuracy\nand latency. In Case Study 2, the same framework modulates dual-heater inputs\non a laboratory TCLab platform (and its digital twin) to maintain a target\naverage temperature under persistent asymmetric disturbances. Compared to\nclassical PID control, our LLM-based controller attains similar performance,\nwhile ablation of the prompting loop reveals its critical role in handling\nnonlinear dynamics. We analyze key failure modes-such as instruction following\nlapses and coarse ODE approximations. Our results demonstrate that, with\nstructured feedback and modular agents, LLMs can unify high-level symbolic\nplanningand low-level continuous control, paving the way towards resilient,\nlanguage-driven automation in chemical engineering."}

Over the next 200\nyears, they spread across Europe and luthiers of various royal courts, eager to\nexperiment with new techniques, created a highly diverse family of instruments.\nAround 1750, size standards were introduced to unify violin making for\norchestras and conservatories. Instruments that fell between two standards were\nthen reduced to a smaller size by luthiers. These reductions have an impact on\nseveral characteristics of violins, in particular on the contour lines, i.e.\nlines of constant altitude, which look more like a U for non reduced\ninstruments and a V for reduced ones. While such differences are observed by\nexperts, they have not been studied quantitatively.\n  This paper presents a method for classifying violins as reduced or\nnon-reduced based on their contour lines. We study a corpus of 25 instruments\nwhose 3D geometric meshes were acquired via photogrammetry. For each\ninstrument, we extract 10-20 contour lines regularly spaced every millimetre.\nEach line is fitted with a parabola-like curve (with an equation of the type y\n= alpha*abs(x)**beta) depending on two parameters, describing how open (beta)\nand how vertically stretched (alpha) the curve is. We compute additional\nfeatures from those parameters, using regressions and counting how many values\nfall under some threshold. We also deal with outliers and non equal numbers of\nlevels, and eventually obtain a numerical profile for each instrument.\n  We then apply classification methods to assess whether geometry alone can\npredict size reduction. We find that distinguishing between reduced and non\nreduced instruments is feasible to some degree, taking into account that a\nwhole spectrum of more or less transformed violins exists, for which it is more\ndifficult to quantify the reduction.

However, it remains unclear if these differences in\nbiases stem from pretraining, finetuning, or even random noise due to training\nstochasticity. We propose a two-step causal experimental approach to\ndisentangle these factors. First, we finetune models multiple times using\ndifferent random seeds to study how training randomness affects over $30$\ncognitive biases. Second, we introduce \\emph{cross-tuning} -- swapping\ninstruction datasets between models to isolate bias sources. This swap uses\ndatasets that led to different bias patterns, directly testing whether biases\nare dataset-dependent.

Training\nexpressive policy classes with online RL present a unique challenge of stable\nvalue maximization. Unlike simpler Gaussian policies commonly used in online\nRL, expressive policies like diffusion and flow-matching policies are\nparameterized by a long denoising chain, which hinders stable gradient\npropagation from actions to policy parameters when optimizing against some\nvalue function. Our key insight is that we can address stable value\nmaximization by avoiding direct optimization over value with the expressive\npolicy and instead construct an on-the-fly RL policy to maximize Q-value. We\npropose Expressive Policy Optimization (EXPO), a sample-efficient online RL\nalgorithm that utilizes an on-the-fly policy to maximize value with two\nparameterized policies -- a larger expressive base policy trained with a stable\nimitation learning objective and a light-weight Gaussian edit policy that edits\nthe actions sampled from the base policy toward a higher value distribution.\nThe on-the-fly policy optimizes the actions from the base policy with the\nlearned edit policy and chooses the value maximizing action from the base and\nedited actions for both sampling and temporal-difference (TD) backup. Our\napproach yields up to 2-3x improvement in sample efficiency on average over\nprior methods both in the setting of fine-tuning a pretrained policy given\noffline data and in leveraging offline data to train online."}

To address this, we propose a\ntraining-free spatio-temporal token merging method, named STTM. Our key insight\nis to exploit local spatial and temporal redundancy in video data which has\nbeen overlooked in prior work. STTM first transforms each frame into\nmulti-granular spatial tokens using a coarse-to-fine search over a quadtree\nstructure, then performs directed pairwise merging across the temporal\ndimension. This decomposed merging approach outperforms existing token\nreduction methods across six video QA benchmarks. Notably, STTM achieves a\n2$\\times$ speed-up with only a 0.5% accuracy drop under a 50% token budget, and\na 3$\\times$ speed-up with just a 2% drop under a 30% budget. Moreover, STTM is\nquery-agnostic, allowing KV cache reuse across different questions for the same\nvideo. The project page is available at https://www.jshyun.me/projects/sttm."}

For the\nstructural level, we introduce a hierarchical suite of segmentation-based\nmetrics, including foreground, semantic, instance, and component masks,\nanchored in granularity-aware correspondence across mask structures.

In\ncontrast, most visual representation learning systems use fixed-length\nrepresentations for all inputs, ignoring variations in complexity or\nfamiliarity. Recent adaptive tokenization methods address this by allocating\nvariable-length representations but typically require test-time search over\nmultiple encodings to find the most predictive one. Inspired by Kolmogorov\nComplexity principles, we propose a single-pass adaptive tokenizer, KARL, which\npredicts the appropriate number of tokens for an image in a single forward\npass, halting once its approximate KC is reached. The token count serves as a\nproxy for the minimum description length. KARL's training procedure closely\nresembles the Upside-Down Reinforcement Learning paradigm, as it learns to\nconditionally predict token halting based on a desired reconstruction quality.\nKARL matches the performance of recent adaptive tokenizers while operating in a\nsingle pass. We present scaling laws for KARL, analyzing the role of\nencoder/decoder size, continuous vs. discrete tokenization and more.\nAdditionally, we offer a conceptual study drawing an analogy between Adaptive\nImage Tokenization and Algorithmic Information Theory, examining the predicted\nimage complexity (KC) across axes such as structure vs. noise and in- vs.\nout-of-distribution familiarity -- revealing alignment with human intuition."}
