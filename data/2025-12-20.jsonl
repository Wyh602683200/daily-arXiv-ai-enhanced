The system composes optical layouts by arranging components from a three-tier toolbox via semantic retrieval, then validates designs through physics simulation with convergent refinement. The architecture combines intent routing, knowledge-augmented generation, and dual-mode validation (QuTiP and FreeSim). We evaluated 13 experiments spanning fundamental optics (Hong-Ou-Mandel interference, Michelson/Mach-Zehnder interferometry, Bell states, delayed-choice quantum eraser), quantum information protocols (BB84 QKD, Franson interferometry, GHZ states, quantum teleportation, hyperentanglement), and advanced technologies (boson sampling, electromagnetically induced transparency, frequency conversion). The system achieves design-simulation alignment scores of 8--9/10, with simulations faithfully modeling intended physics. A critical finding distinguishes structural correctness from quantitative accuracy: high alignment confirms correct physics architecture, while numerical predictions require expert review. Free-form simulation outperformed constrained frameworks for 11/13 experiments, revealing that quantum optics diversity demands flexible mathematical representations. The system democratizes computational experiment design for research and pedagogy, producing strong initial designs users can iteratively refine through conversation."}

This paper introduces the Principle of Proportional Duty (PPD), a novel framework that models how ethical responsibility scales with an agent's epistemic state. The framework reveals that moral duty is not lost to uncertainty but transforms: as uncertainty increases, Action Duty (the duty to act decisively) is proportionally converted into Repair Duty (the active duty to verify, inquire, and resolve uncertainty).\n  This dynamic is expressed by the equation D_total = K[(1-HI) + HI * g(C_signal)], where Total Duty is a function of Knowledge (K), Humility/Uncertainty (HI), and Contextual Signal Strength (C_signal). Monte Carlo simulations demonstrate that systems maintaining a baseline humility coefficient (lambda > 0) produce more stable duty allocations and reduce the risk of overconfident decision-making.\n  By formalizing humility as a system parameter, the PPD offers a mathematically tractable approach to moral responsibility that could inform the development of auditable AI decision systems. This paper applies the framework across four domains, clinical ethics, recipient-rights law, economic governance, and artificial intelligence, to demonstrate its cross-disciplinary validity. The findings suggest that proportional duty serves as a stabilizing principle within complex systems, preventing both overreach and omission by dynamically balancing epistemic confidence against contextual risk."}

Unlike unconstrained text-to-3D approaches, our method operates within a discrete parts vocabulary, enforcing geometric validity, connection constraints, and buildability ordering. Using LDraw as a text-rich intermediate representation, we demonstrate that large language models can be guided with tools to produce valid step-by-step construction sequences and assembly instructions for brick-based prototypes of more than 3000 assembly parts. We introduce a Python library for programmatic model generation and evaluate buildable outputs on complex satellites, aircraft, and architectural domains. The approach aims for demonstrable scalability, modularity, and fidelity that bridges the gap between semantic design intent and manufacturable output. Physical prototyping follows from natural language specifications. The work proposes a novel elemental lingua franca as a key missing piece from the previous pixel-based diffusion methods or computer-aided design (CAD) models that fail to support complex assembly instructions or component exchange. Across four original designs, this novel \"bag of bricks\" method thus functions as a physical API: a constrained vocabulary connecting precisely oriented brick locations to a \"bag of words\" through which arbitrary functional requirements compile into material reality. Given such a consistent and repeatable AI representation opens new design options while guiding natural language implementations in manufacturing and engineering prototyping."}

The approach mirrors the way in which epidemiologists enable public health interventions through statistical evidence before molecular mechanisms are understood. This bypasses the problem of model complexity which plagues current interpretability methods (such as SHAP and mechanistic interpretability) at the scale of deployed models.\n  AI Epidemiology achieves this population-level surveillance by standardising capture of AI-expert interactions into structured assessment fields: risk level, alignment score, and accuracy score. These function as exposure variables which predict output failure through statistical associations, much like cholesterol and blood pressure act as exposure variables predicting cardiac events. Output-failure associations are subsequently validated against expert overrides and real-world outcomes.\n  The framework places zero burden on experts and provides automatic audit trails by passively tracking expert convergence and divergence with AI recommendations. Since it analyses outputs rather than internal model computations, it also provides governance continuity when institutions update models and switch vendors. Finally, by providing reliability scores and semantic assessments (e.g. 'this recommendation resembles 500 cases overridden by experts due to guideline violations'), it enables experts and institutions to detect unreliable AI outputs before they cause harm. This democratises AI oversight by enabling domain experts to govern AI systems without requiring machine learning expertise."}

However, current model-centric agent architectures struggle to self-evolve post-deployment: improving personalization, capability, and efficiency typically requires continuous model retraining/fine-tuning, which incurs prohibitive computational overheads and suffers from an inherent trade-off between model accuracy and inference efficiency.\n  To enable iterative self-evolution without model retraining, we propose MOBIMEM, a memory-centric agent system. MOBIMEM first introduces three specialized memory primitives to decouple agent evolution from model weights: (1) Profile Memory uses a lightweight distance-graph (DisGraph) structure to align with user preferences, resolving the accuracy-latency trade-off in user profile retrieval; (2) Experience Memory employs multi-level templates to instantiate execution logic for new tasks, ensuring capability generalization; and (3) Action Memory records fine-grained interaction sequences, reducing the reliance on expensive model inference. Building upon this memory architecture, MOBIMEM further integrates a suite of OS-inspired services to orchestrate execution: a scheduler that coordinates parallel sub-task execution and memory operations; an agent record-and-replay (AgentRR) mechanism that enables safe and efficient action reuse; and a context-aware exception handling that ensures graceful recovery from user interruptions and runtime errors.\n  Evaluation on AndroidWorld and top-50 apps shows that MOBIMEM achieves 83.1% profile alignment with 23.83 ms retrieval time (280x faster than GraphRAG baselines), improves task success rates by up to 50.3%, and reduces end-to-end latency by up to 9x on mobile devices."}

Effective CE triage requires adaptive decisions that balance retained value against the costs and constraints of processing and labour. This paper presents a novel decision-making framework as a simple deterministic solver over a state-augmented Disassembly Sequencing Planning (DSP) graph. By encoding the disassembly history into the state, our framework enforces the Markov property, enabling optimal, recursive evaluation by ensuring each decision only depends on the previous state. The triage decision involves choices between continuing disassembly or committing to a CE option. The model integrates condition-aware utility based on diagnostic health scores and complex operational constraints. We demonstrate the framework's flexibility with a worked example: the hierarchical triage of electric vehicle (EV) batteries, where decisions are driven by the recursive valuation of components. The example illustrates how a unified formalism enables the accommodation of varying mechanical complexity, safety requirements, and economic drivers. This unified formalism therefore provides a tractable and generalisable foundation for optimising CE triage decisions across diverse products and operational contexts."}

Two Llama models (70B and 8B) were assessed using a multi-dimensional safety framework covering diagnostic restraint, referral adherence, hedging, and emergency recognition. Adversarial queries incorporated parental pressure patterns, including urgency, economic barriers, and challenges to disclaimers. Mean safety score was 5.50/15 (SD=2.41).

Darth Vecdor (DV) was designed to extract this knowledge into a structured, terminology-mapped, SQL database (\"knowledge base\" or \"knowledge graph\").

Although one might query an LLM directly rather than a SQL-based knowledge graph, concerns such as cost, speed, safety, and confidence may arise, especially in high-volume operations. These may be mitigated when the information is pre-extracted from the LLM and becomes query-able through a standard database. However, the author found the need to address several issues. These included erroneous, off-topic, free-text, overly general, and inconsistent LLM responses, as well as allowing for multi-element responses. DV was built with features intended to mitigate these issues. To facilitate ease of use, and to allow for prompt engineering by those with domain expertise but little technical background, DV provides a simple, browser-based graphical user interface. DV has been released as free, open-source, extensible software, on an \"as is\" basis, without warranties or conditions of any kind, either express or implied.

Most of the standard RAG frameworks regard all retrieved information as equally reliable, overlooking the varying credibility and interconnected nature of large textual corpora. GraphRAG approaches offer potential improvement to RAG systems by integrating knowledge graphs, which structure information into nodes and edges, capture entity relationships, and enable multi-step logical traversal. However, GraphRAG is not always an ideal solution as it depends on high-quality graph representations of the corpus, which requires either pre-existing knowledge graphs that are expensive to build and update, or automated graph construction pipelines that are often unreliable. Moreover, systems following this paradigm typically use large language models to guide graph traversal and evidence retrieval, leading to challenges similar to those encountered with standard RAG. In this paper, we propose a novel RAG framework that employs the spreading activation algorithm to retrieve information from a corpus of documents interconnected by automatically constructed knowledge graphs, thereby enhancing the performance of large language models on complex tasks such as multi-hop question answering. Experiments show that our method achieves better or comparable performance to iterative RAG methodologies, while also being easily integrable as a plug-and-play module with a wide range of RAG-based approaches. Combining our method with chain-of-thought iterative retrieval yields up to a 39\\% absolute gain in answer correctness compared to naive RAG, achieving these results with small open-weight language models and highlighting its effectiveness in resource-constrained settings."}

While Large Language Models (LLMs) demonstrate impressive capabilities across diverse tasks, their extensive computational requirements make them cost-prohibitive for routine enterprise use. This limitation motivates the exploration of Small Language Models (SLMs), which can deliver comparable performance in targeted applications while drastically reducing infrastructure overhead (Irugalbandara et al., 2023). In this work, we investigate the feasibility of replacing LLM-driven workflows with optimized SLMs. We trained a domain-adapted SLM to execute representative tasks traditionally handled by LLMs, such as document summarization, query answering, and structured data interpretation. As part of the experiment, we investigated the fine-tuning of facebook/opt-350m model (single epoch only) using the Hugging Face TRL (Transformer Reinforcement Learning), specifically the Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) trainer. The OPT-350M model was released by Meta AI in 2022 as part of the OPT (Open Pretrained Transformer) family of models. Similar studies demonstrate that even models at the 350M parameter scale can meaningfully contribute to instruction-tuning pipelines (Mekala et al., 2024). Experimental results demonstrated that our fine-tuned SLM achieves exceptional performance with a 77.55\\% pass rate on ToolBench evaluation, significantly outperforming all baseline models including ChatGPT-CoT (26.00\\%), ToolLLaMA-DFS (30.18\\%), and ToolLLaMA-CoT (16.27\\%).

While Large Language Models (LLMs) offer powerful reasoning capabilities, their direct application to time series forecasting has proven ineffective. We address this gap by repositioning the LLM as an intelligent judge that evaluates, explains, and strategically coordinates an ensemble of foundation models. To overcome the LLM's inherent lack of domain-specific knowledge on time series, we introduce an R1-style finetuning process, guided by SHAP-based faithfulness scores, which teaches the model to interpret ensemble weights as meaningful causal statements about temporal dynamics. The trained agent then engages in iterative, multi-turn conversations to perform forward-looking assessments, provide causally-grounded explanations for its weighting decisions, and adaptively refine the optimization strategy. Validated on the GIFT-Eval benchmark on 23 datasets across 97 settings, our approach significantly outperforms leading time series foundation models on both CRPS and MASE metrics, establishing new state-of-the-art results."}

While GenAI has the potential to enhance learning experience, it also raises concerns around misinformation, hallucinated outputs, and its potential to undermine critical thinking and problem-solving skills. In response, many universities, colleges, departments, and instructors have begun to develop and adopt policies to guide responsible integration of GenAI into learning environments.

To address this challenge, the authors designed and implemented an automated system for discovering and categorizing AI-related policies found in course syllabi and institutional policy websites. The system combines unsupervised topic modeling techniques to identify key policy themes with large language models (LLMs) to classify the level of GenAI allowance and other requirements in policy texts.

To validate and evaluate this new paradigm for PDE solving , we develop PDE-Bench, a multi-type PDE Benchmark for agent-based tool collaborative solving, and propose multi-level metrics for assessing tool coordination. Evaluations verify that PDE-Agent exhibits superior applicability and performance in complex multi-step, cross-step dependent tasks. This new paradigm of toolchain-augmented multi-agent PDE solving will further advance future developments in automated scientific computing.

Prevailing efforts to address this through enhancing Vision-Language Models (VLMs) are trapped in a dilemma: template-based datasets are scalable but structurally rigid, while manual annotation is linguistically diverse but unscalable and, critically, computationally imprecise. We introduce SPRITE, a novel framework that overcomes this dilemma by leveraging simulators and large models to programmatically synthesize scalable, diverse, and high-quality spatial reasoning data. The core innovation of SPRITE is to reframe ground-truth generation as a code-generation task. We utilize LLMs to compile complex spatial questions into executable programs, which are then verified against high-precision scene meta-information extracted from simulators. This ensures our ground truth is both computationally precise and verifiable, while the generative power of LLMs provides vast linguistic diversity. Leveraging this pipeline, we have curated a dataset encompassing 3 simulators, 11k+ scenes, and 300k+ image/video instruction-tuning pairs. We demonstrate that a VLM trained on our data achieves significant performance gains on multiple spatial benchmarks and outperforms other open-source datasets of equivalent size. Furthermore, a scalability analysis confirms our hypothesis that overcoming the low-diversity nature of traditional template methods is essential for building robust, generalizable spatial intelligence. We will make the SPRITE framework code and the full 300k+ dataset publicly available to facilitate future research in spatial intelligence."}

Yet standard schemes (linear weight soups, task vectors, and Fisher-weighted averaging) can preserve loss while quietly destroying alignment. We argue that merging is not a numerical trick but a geometry-constrained operation around an already-aligned anchor: fusion must be steered to respect safety geometry, not validated post hoc.\n  We introduce AlignMerge, a geometry-aware merging framework that makes alignment an explicit invariant. In a local Fisher chart around an instruction-tuned base, we estimate an alignment subspace with projector P_A and optimize:\n  L_AlignMerge = L_geo + lambda_align * L_align + lambda_bud * L_bud,\n  where L_geo keeps the merge close to its experts in Fisher-Rao geometry, L_align penalizes motion along alignment-sensitive directions, and L_bud enforces a soft alignment budget. As the alignment functional we use the decoding-invariant Alignment Quality Index (AQI), a latent-space criterion that captures how cleanly aligned and misaligned behaviors separate in representation space.\n  Across five model families (LLaMA-3 8B, Mistral 7B, Qwen 2, Phi-3.5, Gemma 2), merging safety anchors with task experts, AlignMerge improves alignment metrics (AQI, toxicity, LLM-judge alignment) while matching or exceeding the best expert on instruction-following, reasoning, and helpfulness. It also exhibits smaller alignment-subspace drift and fewer budget violations than Fisher soups, TIES, SafeMerge, and MergeAlign. These results make alignment-preserving merging a first-class design goal and suggest a path to geometry-aware composition of future foundation models."}

These scenarios are central to multimodal audio-video understanding, where models must jointly reason over audio and visual streams in applications such as conversational video assistants and meeting analytics. We introduce AMUSE, a benchmark designed around tasks that are inherently agentic, requiring models to decompose complex audio-visual interactions into planning, grounding, and reflection steps. It evaluates MLLMs across three modes zero-shot, guided, and agentic and six task families, including spatio-temporal speaker grounding and multimodal dialogue summarization. Across all modes, current models exhibit weak multi-speaker reasoning and inconsistent behavior under both non-agentic and agentic evaluation. Motivated by the inherently agentic nature of these tasks and recent advances in LLM agents, we propose RAFT, a data-efficient agentic alignment framework that integrates reward optimization with intrinsic multimodal self-evaluation as reward and selective parameter adaptation for data and parameter efficient updates. Using RAFT, we achieve up to 39.52\\% relative improvement in accuracy on our benchmark. Together, AMUSE and RAFT provide a practical platform for examining agentic reasoning in multimodal models and improving their capabilities."}

Referee logic plus an efficient top-$k$ predicate updater keeps costs low by prioritizing checks and resolving conflicts hierarchically. Measured on ST-WebAgentBench (ICML CUA~'25) and AgentHarm (ICLR~'25), \\textsc{QuadSentinel} improves guardrail accuracy and rule recall while reducing false positives. Against single-agent baselines such as ShieldAgent (ICML~'25), it yields better overall safety control.

While critic models offer a promising solution, their effectiveness is hindered by the lack of diverse, high-quality GUI feedback data and public critic benchmarks for step-level evaluation in computer use.

To address this gap, we propose ForenAgent, a multi-round interactive IFD framework that enables MLLMs to autonomously generate, execute, and iteratively refine Python-based low-level tools around the detection objective, thereby achieving more flexible and interpretable forgery analysis.

Proof of Quality (PoQ) replaces cryptographic verification of computation with consensus over output quality, but the original formulation ignores heterogeneous computational costs across inference and evaluator nodes. This paper introduces a cost-aware PoQ framework that integrates explicit efficiency measurements into the reward mechanism for both types of nodes. The design combines ground truth token level F1, lightweight learned evaluators, and GPT based judgments within a unified evaluation pipeline, and adopts a linear reward function that balances normalized quality and cost.\n  Experiments on extractive question answering and abstractive summarization use five instruction tuned LLMs ranging from TinyLlama-1.1B to Llama-3.2-3B and three evaluation models spanning cross encoder and bi encoder architectures. Results show that a semantic textual similarity bi encoder achieves much higher correlation with both ground truth and GPT scores than cross encoders, indicating that evaluator architecture is a critical design choice for PoQ. Quality-cost analysis further reveals that the largest models in the pool are also the most efficient in terms of quality per unit latency. Monte Carlo simulations over 5\\,000 PoQ rounds demonstrate that the cost-aware reward scheme consistently assigns higher average rewards to high quality low cost inference models and to efficient evaluators, while penalizing slow low quality nodes. These findings suggest that cost-aware PoQ provides a practical foundation for economically sustainable decentralized LLM inference."}

Despite progress in improving visual realism through advanced simulators and generative AI, recent studies reveal that pixel-level fidelity alone does not ensure reliable transfer from simulation to the real world. What truly matters is whether the system-under-test (SUT) bases its decisions on the same causal evidence in both real and simulated environments - not just whether images \"look real\" to humans. This paper addresses the lack of such a behavior-grounded fidelity measure by introducing Decisive Feature Fidelity (DFF), a new SUT-specific metric that extends the existing fidelity spectrum to capture mechanism parity - the agreement in causal evidence underlying the SUT's decisions across domains. DFF leverages explainable-AI (XAI) methods to identify and compare the decisive features driving the SUT's outputs for matched real-synthetic pairs. We further propose practical estimators based on counterfactual explanations, along with a DFF-guided calibration scheme to enhance simulator fidelity. Experiments on 2126 matched KITTI-VirtualKITTI2 pairs demonstrate that DFF reveals discrepancies overlooked by conventional output-value fidelity.

Although graphics processors dominate modern artificial-intelligence deployment, most consumer hardware--including laptops, desktops, industrial controllers, and embedded systems--relies on central processing units. Despite this, the computational laws governing central-processing-unit-only inference for local language and vision-language workloads remain largely unexplored. We systematically benchmark large language and vision-language models on two representative central-processing-unit tiers widely used for local inference: a MacBook Pro M2, reflecting mainstream laptop-class deployment, and a Raspberry Pi 5, representing constrained, low-power embedded settings. Using a unified methodology based on continuous sampling of processor and memory usage together with area-under-curve integration, we characterize how computational load scales with input text length for language models and with image resolution for vision-language models. We uncover two empirical scaling laws: (1) computational cost for language-model inference scales approximately linearly with token length; and (2) vision-language models exhibit a preprocessing-driven \"resolution knee\", where compute remains constant above an internal resolution clamp and decreases sharply below it. Beyond these laws, we show that quantum-inspired compression reduces processor and memory usage by up to 71.9% and energy consumption by up to 62%, while preserving or improving semantic accuracy. These results provide a systematic quantification of multimodal central-processing-unit-only scaling for local language and vision-language workloads, and they identify model compression and input-resolution preprocessing as effective, low-cost levers for sustainable edge inference."}

During inference, the method requires only a single log-probability computation over the probe prefixes to produce a harmfulness score and apply a threshold, without invoking any additional models or multi-stage inference. To further enhance the discriminative power of the prefixes, we design an efficient prefix construction algorithm that automatically discovers highly informative prefixes, substantially improving detection performance.

We are witnessing the rise of a dangerous literacy gap, where a focus on the functional, operational skills of using AI tools is eclipsing the development of critical and ethical reasoning about them. This position paper argues for a systemic shift toward comprehensive AI literacy that centers human agency - the empowered capacity for intentional, critical, and responsible choice. This principle applies to all stakeholders in the educational ecosystem: it is the student's agency to question, create with, or consciously decide not to use AI based on the task; it is the teacher's agency to design learning experiences that align with instructional values, rather than ceding pedagogical control to a tool. True literacy involves teaching about agency itself, framing technology not as an inevitability to be adopted, but as a choice to be made. This requires a deep commitment to critical thinking and a robust understanding of epistemology. Through the AI Literacy, Fluency, and Competency frameworks described in this paper, educators and students will become agents in their own human-centric approaches to AI, providing necessary pathways to clearly articulate the intentions informing decisions and attitudes toward AI and the impact of these decisions on academic work, career, and society."}

For open-source models, multi-agent consistently improves performance. For example, Qwen-2.5-VL (7B) gains +6.8 points and Qwen-2.5-VL (32B) gains +3.3 on Geometry3K, and both Qwen-2.5-VL variants see further gains on OlympiadBench and We-Math.

Here we argue that this patchwork AGI hypothesis needs to be given serious consideration, and should inform the development of corresponding safeguards and mitigations. The rapid deployment of advanced AI agents with tool-use capabilities and the ability to communicate and coordinate makes this an urgent safety consideration. We therefore propose a framework for distributional AGI safety that moves beyond evaluating and aligning individual agents.

In this paper, we introduce Generative Adversarial Reasoner, an on-policy joint training framework designed to enhance reasoning by co-evolving an LLM reasoner and an LLM-based discriminator through adversarial reinforcement learning. A compute-efficient review schedule partitions each reasoning chain into logically complete slices of comparable length, and the discriminator evaluates each slice's soundness with concise, structured justifications. Learning couples complementary signals: the LLM reasoner is rewarded for logically consistent steps that yield correct answers, while the discriminator earns rewards for correctly detecting errors or distinguishing traces in the reasoning process. This produces dense, well-calibrated, on-policy step-level rewards that supplement sparse exact-match signals, improving credit assignment, increasing sample efficiency, and enhancing overall reasoning quality of LLMs. Across various mathematical benchmarks, the method delivers consistent gains over strong baselines with standard RL post-training.

Instead of relying on costly pixel-level annotations, the proposed method utilizes image-level labels to generate clinically meaningful heatmaps that highlight pneumonia-affected regions. Furthermore, we evaluate seven pre-trained deep learning models, including a Vision Transformer, under identical training conditions, using focal loss and patient-wise splits to prevent data leakage.

This article presents Value Lens, a text-based model designed to detect human values using generative artificial intelligence, specifically Large Language Models (LLMs). The proposed model operates in two stages: the first aims to formulate a formal theory of values, while the second focuses on identifying these values within a given text. In the first stage, an LLM generates a description based on the established theory of values, which experts then verify. In the second stage, a pair of LLMs is employed: one LLM detects the presence of values, and the second acts as a critic and reviewer of the detection process. The results indicate that Value Lens performs comparably to, and even exceeds, the effectiveness of other models that apply different methods for similar tasks."}

Despite decades of use, significant challenges remain in achieving robust generalization across subjects, recording systems, and acquisition protocols. To tackle these challenges, foundation models (FMs) are gaining traction when targeting end-to-end applications based on EMG signals. Yet, existing EMG FMs remain limited to single downstream tasks and lack deployability on embedded platforms. In this work, we present TinyMyo, a lightweight FM based on a Transformer encoder architecture. The model is pre-trained in a self-supervised manner on publicly available datasets and achieves high reconstruction fidelity with only 3.6M parameters. With minimal task-specific head adaptations, the same backbone is used to tackle multiple downstream tasks, leveraging datasets acquired from diverse sensing locations and hardware platforms. We demonstrate generalization across hand gesture classification, hand kinematic regression, speech production and recognition, with performance comparable to or surpassing the state of the art (SoA), and model size below 5M parameters. We achieve SoA results compared to previous FM-based works on the NinaPro DB5 ($89.4\\pm0.16\\%$), UCI-EMG ($97.56\\pm0.32\\%$), and EPN-612 ($96.74\\pm0.09\\%$) datasets.

One of the critical challenges is the continuous emergence of new applications, which generates Out-of-Distribution (OOD) traffic patterns that deviate from known categories and are not well represented by predefined models. Current approaches rely on predefined categories, which limits their effectiveness in handling unknown traffic types. Although some methods mitigate this limitation by simply classifying unknown traffic into a single \"Other\" category, they fail to make a fine-grained classification. In this paper, we propose a Two-stage Adaptive OOD classification Network (TAO-Net) that achieves accurate classification for both In-Distribution (ID) and OOD encrypted traffic. The method incorporates an innovative two-stage design: the first stage employs a hybrid OOD detection mechanism that integrates transformer-based inter-layer transformation smoothness and feature analysis to effectively distinguish between ID and OOD traffic, while the second stage leverages large language models with a novel semantic-enhanced prompt strategy to transform OOD traffic classification into a generation task, enabling flexible fine-grained classification without relying on predefined labels. Experiments on three datasets demonstrate that TAO-Net achieves 96.81-97.70% macro-precision and 96.77-97.68% macro-F1, outperforming previous methods that only reach 44.73-86.30% macro-precision, particularly in identifying emerging network applications."}

Using Monte Carlo data, parameter-efficient fine-tuning, and Direct Preference Optimization (DPO), the model learns the latent structure of a pressurized-water-reactor assembly and generates candidate layouts in a single forward pass. Notably, the DPO-aligned model exhibits emergent design-space expansion: despite being trained exclusively on configurations with a fixed number of gadolinium burnable absorber (Gd) rods, it autonomously adjusts Gd inventory to satisfy strict power-peaking constraints.

Specifically, we first construct a cross-sample bank by segmenting historical data into hypotensive and non-hypotensive samples.

Additionally, we integrate both self-supervised masked reconstruction and retrospective sequence forecasting signals during training to enhance model adaptability to rapid and subtle intraoperative dynamics. We evaluate the proposed CSA-TTA on both the VitalDB dataset and a real-world in-hospital dataset by integrating it with state-of-the-art time series forecasting models, including TimesFM and UniTS. CSA-TTA consistently enhances performance across settings-for instance, on VitalDB, it improves Recall and F1 scores by +1.33% and +1.13%, respectively, under fine-tuning, and by +7.46% and +5.07% in zero-shot scenarios-demonstrating strong robustness and generalization."}

However, these methods restrict the training to a limited subspace, which can sometimes reduce performance.\n  For Small Language Models (SLMs), where efficiency gains matter even more, we introduce AdaGradSelect, an adaptive method that selects which transformer blocks to update based on gradients.\n  Early observations showed that updating only the transformer blocks with the highest gradient norms can achieve performance close to full fine-tuning. Building on this insight, AdaGradSelect adaptively chooses which blocks to train. It uses a combination of Dirichlet-based sampling, which depends on how frequently blocks were updated in the past, and an epsilon-greedy exploration strategy. This lets the method explore different blocks in early training and gradually focus on the most important ones in later epochs.\n  Experiments show that AdaGradSelect trains about 12 percent faster and uses 35 percent less GPU memory while delivering performance very close to full fine-tuning. On the GSM8K dataset, it outperforms LoRA (rank 256) by about 3 percent on average across models such as Qwen2.5-0.5B, LLaMA3.2-1B, and Phi4-mini-3.8B.

Despite decades of research, applying the optimal composition of loop transformations remains challenging due to inherent complexities, including cost modeling for optimization objectives.

However, our key observation is that LLMs often struggle with effective loop transformation optimization, frequently leading to errors or suboptimal optimization, thereby missing opportunities for performance improvements. To bridge this gap, we propose LOOPRAG, a novel retrieval-augmented generation framework designed to guide LLMs in performing effective loop optimization on Static Control Part. We introduce a parameter-driven method to harness loop properties, which trigger various loop transformations, and generate diverse yet legal example codes serving as a demonstration source. To effectively obtain the most informative demonstrations, we propose a loop-aware algorithm based on loop features, which balances similarity and diversity for code retrieval. To enhance correct and efficient code generation, we introduce a feedback-based iterative mechanism that incorporates compilation, testing and performance results as feedback to guide LLMs. Each optimized code undergoes mutation, coverage and differential testing for equivalence checking. We evaluate LOOPRAG on PolyBench, TSVC and LORE benchmark suites, and compare it against compilers (GCC-Graphite, Clang-Polly, Perspective and ICX) and representative LLMs (DeepSeek and GPT-4).

However, these models often exhibit discrepancies from the reality due to unmodeled effects or simplifying assumptions. We refer to this gap as the ignorance model. While purely data-driven approaches attempt to learn full system behavior, they require large amounts of high-quality data across the entire spatial and temporal domain. In real-world scenarios, such information is unavailable, making full data-driven modeling unreliable. To overcome this limitation, we model of the ignorance component using a hybrid twin approach, instead of simulating phenomena from scratch. Since physics-based models approximate the overall behavior of the phenomena, the remaining ignorance is typically lower in complexity than the full physical response, therefore, it can be learned with significantly fewer data. A key difficulty, however, is that spatial measurements are sparse, also obtaining data measuring the same phenomenon for different spatial configurations is challenging in practice. Our contribution is to overcome this limitation by using Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) to represent the ignorance model. GNNs learn the spatial pattern of the missing physics even when the number of measurement locations is limited. This allows us to enrich the physics-based model with data-driven corrections without requiring dense spatial, temporal and parametric data. To showcase the performance of the proposed method, we evaluate this GNN-based hybrid twin on nonlinear heat transfer problems across different meshes, geometries, and load positions. Results show that the GNN successfully captures the ignorance and generalizes corrections across spatial configurations, improving simulation accuracy and interpretability, while minimizing data requirements."}

This threat is particularly concerning under clean-label attack scenarios, as it remains effective while having negligible impact on the utility of the synthetic data. Furthermore, we discover an Early-Stage Trigger Manifestation (ESTM) phenomenon: backdoor trigger patterns tend to surface more explicitly in the early, high-noise stages of the diffusion model's reverse generation process before being subtly integrated into the final samples. Overall, this work reveals a previously underexplored threat in generative data pipelines and provides initial insights toward mitigating backdoor risks in synthetic data generation."}

The temporal complexity of embodied tasks demands a dynamic and adaptable computation mode. Static and lossy acceleration methods, such as quantization, fail to handle such dynamic embodied tasks, while speculative decoding offers a lossless and adaptive yet underexplored alternative for DP. However, it is non-trivial to address the following challenges: how to match the base model's denoising quality at lower cost under time-varying task difficulty in embodied settings, and how to dynamically and interactively adjust computation based on task difficulty in such environments. In this paper, we propose Temporal-aware Reinforcement-based Speculative Diffusion Policy (TS-DP), the first framework that enables speculative decoding for DP with temporal adaptivity. First, to handle dynamic environments where task difficulty varies over time, we distill a Transformer-based drafter to imitate the base model and replace its costly denoising calls. Second, an RL-based scheduler further adapts to time-varying task difficulty by adjusting speculative parameters to maintain accuracy while improving efficiency. Extensive experiments across diverse embodied environments demonstrate that TS-DP achieves up to 4.17 times faster inference with over 94% accepted drafts, reaching an inference frequency of 25 Hz and enabling real-time diffusion-based control without performance degradation."}

However, recent technological advances in artificial intelligence (AI) and adjacent digital frontier technologies pose significant challenges to the protection and realization of these rights. This owes to the increasing influence of AI systems on the creation and depiction of cultural content, affect the use and distribution of the intellectual property of individuals and communities, and influence cultural participation and expression worldwide. In addition, the growing influence of AI thus risks exacerbating preexisting economic, social and digital divides and reinforcing inequities for marginalized communities. This dynamic challenges the existing interplay between cultural rights and the right to development, and raises questions about the integration of cultural and developmental considerations into emerging AI governance frameworks. To address these challenges, the paper examines the impact of AI on both categories of rights. Conceptually, it analyzes the epistemic and normative limitations of AI with respect to cultural and developmental assumptions embedded in algorithmic design and deployment, but also individual and structural impacts of AI on both rights. On this basis, the paper identifies gaps and tensions in existing AI governance frameworks with respect to cultural rights and the right to development.\n  By situating cultural rights and the right to development within the broader landscape of AI and human rights, this paper contributes to the academic discourse on AI ethics, legal frameworks, and international human rights law.

AI tools embedded in digital devices support decision-making and operational management at both individual and organizational levels, including resource allocation, workflow automation, and real-time data analysis. However, the prevailing cloud-centric deployment of AI carries a substantial environmental footprint due to high computational demands. In this context, this paper introduces the concept of agentic environments, a sustainability-oriented AI framework that extends beyond reactive systems by leveraging GenAI, multi-agent systems, and edge computing to reduce the environmental impact of technology. Agentic environments enable more efficient resource use, improved quality of life, and sustainability-by-design, while simultaneously enhancing data privacy through decentralized, edge-driven solutions. Drawing on secondary research as well as primary data from focus groups and semi-structured interviews with AI professionals from leading technology companies, the paper proposes a conceptual framework for agentic environments examined through three lenses: the personal sphere, professional and commercial use, and urban operations. The findings highlight the potential of agentic environments to foster sustainable ecosystems through optimized resource utilization and strengthened data privacy. The study concludes with recommendations for edge-driven deployment models to reduce reliance on energy-intensive cloud infrastructures."}

Because of their impact on society, developing and deploying these language models must be done responsibly, with attention to their negative impacts and possible harms. In this scenario, the number of AI Ethics Tools (AIETs) publications has recently increased. These AIETs are designed to help developers, companies, governments, and other stakeholders establish trust, transparency, and responsibility with their technologies by bringing accepted values to guide AI's design, development, and use stages. However, many AIETs lack good documentation, examples of use, and proof of their effectiveness in practice. This paper presents a methodology for evaluating AIETs in language models. Our approach involved an extensive literature survey on 213 AIETs, and after applying inclusion and exclusion criteria, we selected four AIETs: Model Cards, ALTAI, FactSheets, and Harms Modeling. For evaluation, we applied AIETs to language models developed for the Portuguese language, conducting 35 hours of interviews with their developers. The evaluation considered the developers' perspective on the AIETs' use and quality in helping to identify ethical considerations about their model. The results suggest that the applied AIETs serve as a guide for formulating general ethical considerations about language models. However, we note that they do not address unique aspects of these models, such as idiomatic expressions. Additionally, these AIETs did not help to identify potential negative impacts of models for the Portuguese language."}

For example, underlying an action ``\\textit{report a witnessed crime}\" are social norms that inform our conduct, such as ``\\textit{It is expected to be brave to report crimes}''. Current AI systems that assess valence (i.e., support or oppose) of human actions by leveraging large-scale data training not grounded on explicit norms may be difficult to explain, and thus untrustworthy. Emulating human assessors by considering social norms can help AI models better understand and predict valence. While multiple norms come into play, conflicting norms can create tension and directly influence human behavior. For example, when deciding whether to ``\\textit{report a witnessed crime}'', one may balance \\textit{bravery} against \\textit{self-protection}. In this paper, we introduce \\textit{ClarityEthic}, a novel ethical assessment approach, to enhance valence prediction and explanation by generating conflicting social norms behind human actions, which strengthens the moral reasoning capabilities of language models by using a contrastive learning strategy. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method outperforms strong baseline approaches, and human evaluations confirm that the generated social norms provide plausible explanations for the assessment of human behaviors."}

This study scrutinizes the AI \"dual-use\" dilemma, functioning as both a cyber-threat vector and forensic automation mechanism, to delineate privacy boundaries in high-stakes investigations. Employing a doctrinal legal methodology, the research synthesizes statutory analysis of the DPDP Act with global ethical frameworks (IEEE, EU) to evaluate regulatory efficacy. Preliminary results indicate that while Machine Learning offers high accuracy in pattern recognition, it introduces vulnerabilities regarding data poisoning and algorithmic bias. Findings highlight a critical tension between the Act's data minimization principles and forensic data retention requirements. Furthermore, the paper identifies that existing legal definitions inadequately encompass AI-driven \"tool crimes\" and \"target crimes.\" Consequently, the research proposes a \"human-centric\" forensic model prioritizing explainable AI (XAI) to ensure evidence admissibility.

These models are designed to move beyond narrow pattern recognition towards emulating sophisticated clinical reasoning, understanding complex spatial relationships, and integrating multimodal data with unprecedented flexibility. However, a critical gap exists between this potential and the current reality, where the clinical evaluation and deployment of FMs are hampered by significant challenges. Herein, we critically assess the current state-of-the-art, analyzing hype by examining the core capabilities and limitations of FMs in the biomedical domain. We also provide a taxonomy of reasoning, ranging from emulated sequential logic and spatial understanding to the integration of explicit symbolic knowledge, to evaluate whether these models exhibit genuine cognition or merely mimic surface-level patterns. We argue that a critical frontier lies beyond statistical correlation, in the pursuit of causal inference, which is essential for building robust models that understand cause and effect. Furthermore, we discuss the paramount issues in deployment stemming from trustworthiness, bias, and safety, dissecting the challenges of algorithmic bias, data bias and privacy, and model hallucinations. We also draw attention to the need for more inclusive, rigorous, and clinically relevant validation frameworks to ensure their safe and ethical application. We conclude that while the vision of autonomous AI-doctors remains distant, the immediate reality is the emergence of powerful technology and assistive tools that would benefit clinical practice. The future of FMs in biomedical imaging hinges not on scale alone, but on developing hybrid, causally aware, and verifiably safe systems that augment, rather than replace, human expertise."}

Python code blocks can execute complex actions into a single step and print only relevant results which helps in keeping the context lean. However, the probabilistic instability issue still remains, as for the same task in the same environment, the agent can follow different trajectories due to the probabilistic nature of LLMs. Therefore, we need procedural memory for consistency and reliability.

Artificial networks typically replicate this via recurrent or parallel architectures, yet incur high energy costs and noise sensitivity. Here we report IPNet, a hardware-software co-designed neuromorphic architecture realizing human-like working memory via neuronal intrinsic plasticity. Exploiting Joule-heating dynamics of Magnetic Tunnel Junctions (MTJs), IPNet physically emulates biological memory volatility. The memory behavior of the proposed architecture shows similar trends in n-back, free recall and memory interference tasks to that of reported human subjects. Implemented exclusively with MTJ neurons, the architecture with human-like working memory achieves 99.65% accuracy on 11-class DVS gesture datasets and maintains 99.48% on a novel 22-class time-reversed benchmark, outperforming RNN, LSTM, and 2+1D CNN baselines sharing identical backbones. For autonomous driving (DDD-20), IPNet reduces steering prediction error by 14.4% compared to ResNet-LSTM. Architecturally, we identify a 'Memory-at-the-Frontier' effect where performance is maximized at the sensing interface, validating a bio-plausible near-sensor processing paradigm. Crucially, all results rely on raw parameters from fabricated devices without optimization. Hardware-in-the-loop validation confirms the system's physical realizability. Separately, energy analysis reveals a reduction in memory power of 2,874x compared to LSTMs and 90,920x versus parallel 3D-CNNs. This capacitor-free design enables a compact ~1.5um2 footprint (28 nm CMOS): a >20-fold reduction over standard LIF neurons.

While tools greatly improve the capabilities of LMs, they also introduce performance bottlenecks during the inference process. In this paper, we introduce novel systems optimizations to address such performance bottlenecks by speculating tool calls and forcing sequences to remain resident in the inference engine to minimize overheads. Our optimizations lead to throughput improvements of several hundred tokens per second when hosting inference for LM agents.

This limitation can be attributed to the fact that MLLMs learn visual understanding primarily from textual descriptions, which constitute a subjective and inherently incomplete supervisory signal. Furthermore, the modest scale of multimodal instruction tuning compared to massive text-only pre-training leads MLLMs to overfit language priors while overlooking visual details. To address these issues, we introduce JARVIS, a JEPA-inspired framework for self-supervised visual enhancement in MLLMs. Specifically, we integrate the I-JEPA learning paradigm into the standard vision-language alignment pipeline of MLLMs training. Our approach leverages frozen vision foundation models as context and target encoders, while training the predictor, implemented as the early layers of an LLM, to learn structural and semantic regularities from images without relying exclusively on language supervision.

Rate coding is efficient for fast sensorimotor processing that occurs within a few seconds. Much less is known about long-term working memory with a time scale of hours (Ericsson and Kintsch, 1995). The discovery of the millisecond precision of spike initiation in cortical neurons was unexpected (Mainen and Sejnowski, 1995). Even more striking was the precision of spiking in vivo, in response to rapidly fluctuating sensory inputs, suggesting that neural circuits could, in principle, preserve and manipulate sensory information through spike timing. It could support spike-timing-dependent plasticity (STDP), which is triggered by the relative timing of spikes between presynaptic and postsynaptic neurons in the millisecond range. What spike-timing mechanisms could regulate STDP in vivo? Cortical traveling waves have been observed across many frequency bands with high temporal precision. Traveling waves have wave fronts that could link spike timing to STDP. As a wave front passes through a cortical column, excitatory synapses on the dendrites of both pyramidal and basket cells are synchronously stimulated. Inhibitory basket cells form a calyx on pyramidal cell bodies, and inhibitory rebound following a strong transient hyperpolarization can trigger a backpropagating action potential, which arrives shortly after the excitatory inputs on pyramidal dendrites. STDP activated in this way could persist for hours, creating a second-tier network. This temporary network could support long-term working memory, a cognitive network riding above the long-term sensorimotor network. On their own, traveling waves and STDP have not yet yielded new insights into cortical function. Together, they could be responsible for how we think (Sejnowski, 2025)."}

Trusted for their ability to act without direct oversight, such agents are increasingly considered in high-stakes domains including financial management, dispute resolution, and governance. Yet in practice, agents execute on infrastructure controlled by a host, who can tamper with models, inputs, or outputs, undermining any meaningful notion of autonomy.\n  We address this gap by introducing VET (Verifiable Execution Traces), a formal framework that achieves host-independent authentication of agent outputs and takes a step toward host-independent autonomy. Central to VET is the Agent Identity Document (AID), which specifies an agent's configuration together with the proof systems required for verification. VET is compositional: it supports multiple proof mechanisms, including trusted hardware, succinct cryptographic proofs, and notarized TLS transcripts (Web Proofs).\n  We implement VET for an API-based LLM agent and evaluate our instantiation on realistic workloads. We find that for today's black-box, secret-bearing API calls, Web Proofs appear to be the most practical choice, with overhead typically under 3$\\times$ compared to direct API calls, while for public API calls, a lower-overhead TEE Proxy is often sufficient. As a case study, we deploy a verifiable trading agent that produces proofs for each decision and composes Web Proofs with a TEE Proxy. Our results demonstrate that practical, host-agnostic authentication is already possible with current technology, laying the foundation for future systems that achieve full host-independent autonomy."}

StructBioReasoner employs a novel tournament-based reasoning framework where specialized agents compete to generate and refine therapeutic hypotheses, naturally distributing computational load for efficient exploration of the vast design space. Agents integrate domain knowledge with access to literature synthesis, AI-structure prediction, molecular simulations, and stability analysis, coordinating their execution on HPC infrastructure via an extensible federated agentic middleware, Academy.

While architectural abstractions offer a means to manage these systems, maintaining their consistency with the actual code has been problematic. The Java Platform Module System (JPMS), introduced in Java 9, addresses this limitation by enabling explicit module specification at the language level. JPMS enhances architectural implementation through improved encapsulation and direct specification of ground-truth architectures within Java projects. Although many projects are written in Java, modularizing existing monolithic projects to JPMS modules is an open challenge due to ineffective module recovery by existing architecture recovery techniques. To address this challenge, this paper presents ClassLAR (Class-and Language model-based Architectural Recovery), a novel, lightweight, and efficient approach that recovers Java modules from monolithic Java systems using fully-qualified class names. ClassLAR leverages language models to extract semantic information from package and class names, capturing both structural and functional intent.

Our main result is an efficient query algorithm that, from noisy oracle access to $f$, identifies all feature directions whose responses are non-degenerate and reconstructs the function $f$. Crucially, our algorithm works in a significantly more general setting than all related prior results -- we allow for essentially arbitrary superpositions, only requiring that $v_i, v_j$ are not nearly identical for $i \\neq j$, and general response functions $σ_i$.

Conventional approaches often rely on location-independent parameterizations and independent training, underutilizing transfer learning and spatial heterogeneity in the inputs, and limiting their applicability in regions with substantial variability. We propose FTBSC-KGML (Fine-Tuning-Based Site Calibration-Knowledge-Guided Machine Learning), a pretraining- and fine-tuning-based, spatial-variability-aware, and knowledge-guided machine learning framework that augments KGML-ag with a pretraining-fine-tuning process and site-specific parameters. Using a pretraining-fine-tuning process with remote-sensing GPP, climate, and soil covariates collected across multiple midwestern sites, FTBSC-KGML estimates land emissions while leveraging transfer learning and spatial heterogeneity. A key component is a spatial-heterogeneity-aware transfer-learning scheme, which is a globally pretrained model that is fine-tuned at each state or site to learn place-aware representations, thereby improving local accuracy under limited data without sacrificing interpretability. Empirically, FTBSC-KGML achieves lower validation error and greater consistency in explanatory power than a purely global model, thereby better capturing spatial variability across states.

While the traditional approach to capturing these evaluations is to conduct a user study, recent work has proposed utilizing machine learning instead. However, existing data-driven methods require large amounts of labeled data, which limits their use in practice. To address this gap, we propose leveraging the few-shot learning capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) to improve how well a robot can predict a user's perception of its performance, and study this idea experimentally in social navigation tasks. To this end, we extend the SEAN TOGETHER dataset with additional real-world human-robot navigation episodes and participant feedback. Using this augmented dataset, we evaluate the ability of several LLMs to predict human perceptions of robot performance from a small number of in-context examples, based on observed spatio-temporal cues of the robot and surrounding human motion. Our results demonstrate that LLMs can match or exceed the performance of traditional supervised learning models while requiring an order of magnitude fewer labeled instances. We further show that prediction performance can improve with more in-context examples, confirming the scalability of our approach. Additionally, we investigate what kind of sensor-based information an LLM relies on to make these inferences by conducting an ablation study on the input features considered for performance prediction. Finally, we explore the novel application of personalized examples for in-context learning, i.e., drawn from the same user being evaluated, finding that they further enhance prediction accuracy. This work paves the path to improving robot behavior in a scalable manner through user-centered feedback."}

The results reveal substantial gaps in bias across languages used in LLMs. For example, Arabic and Spanish consistently show higher levels of stereotype bias, while Chinese and English exhibit lower levels of bias. We also identify contrasting patterns across bias types. Age shows the lowest explicit bias but the highest implicit bias, emphasizing the importance of detecting implicit biases that are undetectable with standard benchmarks.

However, existing benchmarks for LLM-as-a-Judge are mainly relying on human-annotated ground truth, which introduces human bias that undermines the assessment of reliability and imposes scalability constraints. To overcome these limitations, we introduce Sage, a novel evaluation suite that assesses the quality of LLM judges without necessitating any human annotation. Inspired by axioms of rational choice theory, Sage introduces two new lenses for measuring LLM-as-a-Judge: local self-consistency (pair-wise preference stability) and global logical consistency (transitivity across a full set of preferences). We curate a dataset of 650 questions by combining structured benchmark problems with real-world user queries. Our experiments demonstrate both the stability of our metrics and their high correlation with supervised benchmarks like LLMBar and RewardBench2, confirming Sage's reliability as an evaluation suite for the robustness and accuracy of LLM-as-a-Judge. Based on Sage, we reveal that current state-of-the-art LLMs exhibit significant reliability problems when acting as judges in both scoring and pairwise settings; even the top-performing models, Gemini-2.5-Pro and GPT-5, fail to maintain consistent preferences in nearly a quarter of difficult cases. We attribute this to a new phenomenon called situational preference, which explains why explicit rubrics or criteria can help the model judge consistently across answer pairs. Our further analysis shows that finetuned LLM-as-a-Judge is a feasible method to boost performance, and the panel-based judge as well as deep reasoning can enhance the judging consistency. We also find substantial inconsistency in human judgments, which indicates that human annotation may not be a reliable gold standard."}

We propose CauStream, a unified framework for causal spatiotemporal streamflow forecasting. CauSTream jointly learns (i) a runoff causal graph among meteorological forcings and (ii) a routing graph capturing dynamic dependencies across stations. We further establish identifiability conditions for these causal structures under a nonparametric setting. We evaluate CauSTream on three major U.S. river basins across three forecasting horizons. The model consistently outperforms prior state-of-the-art methods, with performance gaps widening at longer forecast windows, indicating stronger generalization to unseen conditions. Beyond forecasting, CauSTream also learns causal graphs that capture relationships among hydrological factors and stations. The inferred structures align closely with established domain knowledge, offering interpretable insights into watershed dynamics.

To address this, we evaluate emotional 3D animation generative models within a Virtual Reality (VR) environment, emphasizing user-centric metrics emotional arousal realism, naturalness, enjoyment, diversity, and interaction quality in a real-time human-agent interaction scenario. Through a user study (N=48), we examine perceived emotional quality for three state of the art speech-driven 3D animation methods across two emotions happiness (high arousal) and neutral (mid arousal). Additionally, we compare these generative models against real human expressions obtained via a reconstruction-based method to assess both their strengths and limitations and how closely they replicate real human facial and body expressions. Our results demonstrate that methods explicitly modeling emotions lead to higher recognition accuracy compared to those focusing solely on speech-driven synchrony. Users rated the realism and naturalness of happy animations significantly higher than those of neutral animations, highlighting the limitations of current generative models in handling subtle emotional states. Generative models underperformed compared to reconstruction-based methods in facial expression quality, and all methods received relatively low ratings for animation enjoyment and interaction quality, emphasizing the importance of incorporating user-centric evaluations into generative model development.

Union based semantic table retrieval attains 54.8 % P@1 overall (54.6 % on citation, 31.3 % on inheritance, 30.6 % on shared dataset signals); table based dense retrieval reaches 66.5 % P@1, and metadata hybrid retrieval achieves 54.1 %. This evaluation indicates clear room for developing better table search methods. By releasing ModelTables and its creation protocol, we provide the first large scale benchmark of structured data describing AI model. Our use case of table discovery in Model Lakes, provides intuition and evidence for developing more accurate semantic retrieval, structured comparison, and principled organization of structured model knowledge.

However, existing methods often generate text that mimics the linguistic style of radiologists but fails to guarantee clinical correctness, because they are trained on token-level objectives which focus on word-choice and sentence structure rather than actual medical accuracy. We propose a semantic-driven reinforcement learning (SRL) method for medical report generation, adopted on a large vision-language model (LVLM). SRL adopts Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) to encourage clinical-correctness-guided learning beyond imitation of language style. Specifically, we optimise a report-level reward: a margin-based cosine similarity (MCCS) computed between key radiological findings extracted from generated and reference reports, thereby directly aligning clinical-label agreement and improving semantic correctness. A lightweight reasoning format constraint further guides the model to generate structured \"thinking report\" outputs. We evaluate Medical Report Generation with Sematic-driven Reinforment Learning (MRG-R1), on two datasets: IU X-Ray and MIMIC-CXR using clinical efficacy (CE) metrics. MRG-R1 achieves state-of-the-art performance with CE-F1 51.88 on IU X-Ray and 40.39 on MIMIC-CXR. We found that the label-semantic reinforcement is better than conventional token-level supervision.

To address this issue, we propose Ev-Trust, a strategy-equilibrium trust mechanism grounded in evolutionary game theory. This mechanism integrates direct trust, indirect trust, and expected revenue into a dynamic feedback structure that guides agents' behavioral evolution toward equilibria. Within a decentralized \"Request-Response-Payment-Evaluation\" service framework, Ev-Trust enables agents to adaptively adjust strategies, naturally excluding malicious participants while reinforcing high-quality collaboration. Furthermore, our theoretical derivation based on replicator dynamics equations proves the existence and stability of local evolutionary equilibria. Experimental results indicate that our approach effectively reflects agent trustworthiness in LLM-driven open service interaction scenarios, reduces malicious strategies, and increases collective revenue. We hope Ev-Trust can provide a new perspective on trust modeling for the agentic service web in group evolutionary game scenarios."}

Rapid mass flows, including landslides and avalanches, cause several thousand deaths across a wide range of environments, often travelling many kilometres from their source. The wide range of source conditions and material properties governing these flows makes their runout difficult to anticipate, particularly for downstream communities that may be suddenly exposed to severe impacts. Accurately predicting runout at scale requires models that are both physically realistic and computationally efficient, yet existing approaches face a fundamental speed-realism trade-off. Here we train a machine learning model to predict geohazard runout across representative real world terrains. The model predicts both flow extent and deposit thickness with high accuracy and 100 to 10,000 times faster computation than numerical solvers. It is trained on over 100,000 numerical simulations across over 10,000 real world digital elevation model chips and reproduces key physical behaviours, including avulsion and deposition patterns, while generalizing across different flow types, sizes and landscapes. Our results demonstrate that neural emulation enables rapid, spatially resolved runout prediction across diverse real world terrains, opening new opportunities for disaster risk reduction and impact-based forecasting.

This approach precisely compresses and isolates the essential information required for generalizable knowledge correction while minimizing disruption to unrelated model behaviors.

This raises a critical question: can OOD detection be extended to OOD classification without true label information? To address this question, we propose a Coarse-to-Fine open-set Classification (CFC) framework that leverages large language models (LLMs) for graph datasets. CFC consists of three key components: a coarse classifier that uses LLM prompts for OOD detection and outlier label generation, a GNN-based fine classifier trained with OOD samples identified by the coarse classifier for enhanced OOD detection and ID classification, and refined OOD classification achieved through LLM prompts and post-processed OOD labels. Unlike methods that rely on synthetic or auxiliary OOD samples, CFC employs semantic OOD instances that are genuinely out-of-distribution based on their inherent meaning, improving interpretability and practical utility. Experimental results show that CFC improves OOD detection by ten percent over state-of-the-art methods on graph and text domains and achieves up to seventy percent accuracy in OOD classification on graph datasets."}

In this setting, we find that even production deployed LaaJs can miss domain critical errors, revealing consistent blind spots in their evaluation capabilities.\n  To better understand these blind spots, we analyze generated COBOL programs and associated LaaJs judgments, drawing on expert knowledge to construct a preliminary taxonomy. Based on this taxonomy, we develop a lightweight analytic checker tool that flags over 30 domain specific issues observed in practice. We use its outputs as analytic hints, dynamically injecting them into the judges prompt to encourage LaaJ to revisit aspects it may have overlooked.\n  Experiments on a test set of 100 programs using four production level LaaJs show that LaaJ alone detects only about 45% of the errors present in the code (in all judges we tested), while the analytic checker alone lacks explanatory depth.

These operations are run by organized crime syndicates that traffic thousands of people into forced labor, requiring them to build emotional intimacy with victims over weeks of text conversations before pressuring them into fraudulent cryptocurrency investments. Because the scams are inherently text-based, they raise urgent questions about the role of Large Language Models (LLMs) in both current and future automation.\n  We investigate this intersection by interviewing 145 insiders and 5 scam victims, performing a blinded long-term conversation study comparing LLM scam agents to human operators, and executing an evaluation of commercial safety filters. Our findings show that LLMs are already widely deployed within scam organizations, with 87% of scam labor consisting of systematized conversational tasks readily susceptible to automation. In a week-long study, an LLM agent not only elicited greater trust from study participants (p=0.007) but also achieved higher compliance with requests than human operators (46% vs. 18% for humans). Meanwhile, popular safety filters detected 0.0% of romance baiting dialogues. Together, these results suggest that romance-baiting scams may be amenable to full-scale LLM automation, while existing defenses remain inadequate to prevent their expansion."}

Our method independently evaluates multiple PTQ algorithms on each layer and employs Linear Centered Kernel Alignment (CKA) as a metric to automatically select the optimal quantization strategy per layer.

Recent studies suggest that machine unlearning can help ensure deployed models comply with evolving legal, safety, and governance requirements. However, current unlearning techniques assume clean separation between forget and retain datasets, which is challenging in operational settings characterized by highly entangled distributions. In such scenarios, perturbation-based methods often degrade general model utility or fail to ensure safety. To address this, we propose Selective Representation Misdirection for Unlearning (SRMU), a novel principled activation-editing framework that enforces feature-aware and directionally controlled perturbations. Unlike indiscriminate model weights perturbations, SRMU employs a structured misdirection vector with an activation importance map. The goal is to allow SRMU selectively suppresses harmful representations while preserving the utility on benign ones. Experiments are conducted on the widely used WMDP benchmark across low- and high-entanglement configurations. Empirical results reveal that SRMU delivers state-of-the-art unlearning performance with minimal utility losses, and remains effective under 20-30\\% overlap where existing baselines collapse. SRMU provides a robust foundation for safety-driven model governance, privacy compliance, and controlled knowledge removal in the emerging LLM-based applications.

However, this architecture also introduces a new and severe privacy risk, which we term Tools Orchestration Privacy Risk (TOP-R), where an agent, to achieve a benign user goal, autonomously aggregates information fragments across multiple tools and leverages its reasoning capabilities to synthesize unexpected sensitive information. We provide the first systematic study of this risk. First, we establish a formal framework, attributing the risk's root cause to the agent's misaligned objective function: an overoptimization for helpfulness while neglecting privacy awareness. Second, we construct TOP-Bench, comprising paired leakage and benign scenarios, to comprehensively evaluate this risk. To quantify the trade-off between safety and robustness, we introduce the H-Score as a holistic metric. The evaluation results reveal that TOP-R is a severe risk: the average Risk Leakage Rate (RLR) of eight representative models reaches 90.24%, while the average H-Score is merely 0.167, with no model exceeding 0.3. Finally, we propose the Privacy Enhancement Principle (PEP) method, which effectively mitigates TOP-R, reducing the Risk Leakage Rate to 46.58% and significantly improving the H-Score to 0.624. Our work reveals both a new class of risk and inherent structural limitations in current agent architectures, while also offering feasible mitigation strategies."}

In typical deployments, visual data captured at edge devices (clients) is transmitted to the server for VLM inference. However, resizing the original image (global image) to match the vision encoder's input resolution often discards fine-grained details, leading to accuracy degradation. To overcome this limitation, we design a two-stage framework. In the first stage, the server performs inference on the global image and identifies a region of interest (RoI) using the VLM's internal attention. The min-entropy of the output tokens is then computed as a confidence measure to determine whether retransmission is required. If the min-entropy exceeds a predefined threshold, the server requests the edge device to send a detail-preserved local image of the RoI. The server then refines its inference by jointly leveraging the global and local images. This selective retransmission strategy ensures that only essential visual content is transmitted. Experiments across multiple VLM architectures show that the proposed framework significantly reduces communication cost while maintaining inference accuracy."}

Kascade computes exact Top-k indices in a small set of anchor layers, then reuses those indices in intermediate reuse layers. The anchor layers are selected algorithmically, via a dynamic-programming objective that maximizes cross-layer similarity over a development set, allowing easy deployment across models. The method incorporates efficient implementation constraints (e.g. tile-level operations), across both prefill and decode attention. The Top-k selection and reuse in Kascade is head-aware and we show in our experiments that this is critical for high accuracy.

Our approach utilizes Gaussian Splatting, since it is more explicit and thus more amenable to constraints than NeRFs. We leverage segmentation annotations to align the semantic regions of the face, facilitating the reconstruction of a neutral pose from only 11 images (as opposed to requiring a long video). We soft constrain the Gaussians to an underlying triangulated surface in order to provide a more structured Gaussian Splat reconstruction, which in turn informs subsequent perturbations to increase the accuracy of the underlying triangulated surface. The resulting triangulated surface can then be used in a standard graphics pipeline. In addition, and perhaps most impactful, we show how accurate geometry enables the Gaussian Splats to be transformed into texture space where they can be treated as a view-dependent neural texture. This allows one to use high visual fidelity Gaussian Splatting on any asset in a scene without the need to modify any other asset or any other aspect (geometry, lighting, renderer, etc.) of the graphics pipeline. We utilize a relightable Gaussian model to disentangle texture from lighting in order to obtain a delit high-resolution albedo texture that is also readily usable in a standard graphics pipeline. The flexibility of our system allows for training with disparate images, even with incompatible lighting, facilitating robust regularization. Finally, we demonstrate the efficacy of our approach by illustrating its use in a text-driven asset creation pipeline."}

To address this challenge, we need to develop fairness evaluation methodologies for multi-agent predictive systems and measure the fairness characteristics of these systems in the financial tabular domain. Examining fairness metrics using large-scale simulations across diverse multi-agent configurations, with varying communication and collaboration mechanisms, we reveal patterns of emergent bias in financial decision-making that cannot be traced to individual agent components, indicating that multi-agent systems may exhibit genuinely collective behaviors. Our findings highlight that fairness risks in financial multi-agent systems represent a significant component of model risk, with tangible impacts on tasks such as credit scoring and income estimation.

One of the applications of the IoT is in the field of medicine, which is called the Internet of Medical Things (IoMT). Acute Lymphocytic Leukemia (ALL) is a type of cancer categorized as a hematic disease. It usually begins in the bone marrow due to the overproduction of immature White Blood Cells (WBCs or leukocytes). Since it has a high rate of spread to other body organs, it is a fatal disease if not diagnosed and treated early. Therefore, for identifying cancerous (ALL) cells in medical diagnostic laboratories, blood, as well as bone marrow smears, are taken by pathologists. However, manual examinations face limitations due to human error risk and time-consuming procedures. So, to tackle the mentioned issues, methods based on Artificial Intelligence (AI), capable of identifying cancer from non-cancer tissue, seem vital. Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) are the most efficient machine learning (ML) methods. These techniques employ multiple layers to extract higher-level features from the raw input.

Currently, the field heavily relies on facial expression recognition (FER) because visual channel conveys rich emotional cues. However, facial expressions are often used as social tools rather than manifestations of genuine inner emotions. To understand and bridge this gap between FER and ER, we introduce eye behaviors as an important emotional cue and construct an Eye-behavior-aided Multimodal Emotion Recognition (EMER) dataset. To collect data with genuine emotions, spontaneous emotion induction paradigm is exploited with stimulus material, during which non-invasive eye behavior data, like eye movement sequences and eye fixation maps, is captured together with facial expression videos. To better illustrate the gap between ER and FER, multi-view emotion labels for mutimodal ER and FER are separately annotated. Furthermore, based on the new dataset, we design a simple yet effective Eye-behavior-aided MER Transformer (EMERT) that enhances ER by bridging the emotion gap. EMERT leverages modality-adversarial feature decoupling and a multitask Transformer to model eye behaviors as a strong complement to facial expressions. In the experiment, we introduce seven multimodal benchmark protocols for a variety of comprehensive evaluations of the EMER dataset.

The 2D component of the final 3D human pose benefits from the detected 2D poses, whereas its depth counterpart must be estimated from scratch. The lifting-based methods encode the detected 2D pose and unknown depth in an entangled feature space, explicitly introducing depth uncertainty to the detected 2D pose, thereby limiting overall estimation accuracy. This work reveals that the depth representation is pivotal for the estimation process. Specifically, when depth is in an initial, completely unknown state, jointly encoding depth features with 2D pose features is detrimental to the estimation process. In contrast, when depth is initially refined to a more dependable state via network-based estimation, encoding it together with 2D pose information is beneficial. To address this limitation, we present a Mixture-of-Experts network for monocular 3D pose estimation named PoseMoE. Our approach introduces: (1) A mixture-of-experts network where specialized expert modules refine the well-detected 2D pose features and learn the depth features. This mixture-of-experts design disentangles the feature encoding process for 2D pose and depth, therefore reducing the explicit influence of uncertain depth features on 2D pose features. (2) A cross-expert knowledge aggregation module is proposed to aggregate cross-expert spatio-temporal contextual information. This step enhances features through bidirectional mapping between 2D pose and depth. Extensive experiments show that our proposed PoseMoE outperforms the conventional lifting-based methods on three widely used datasets: Human3.6M, MPI-INF-3DHP, and 3DPW."}

Rather than treating cosmology, astrophysics, geophysics, biology, cognition, and machine intelligence as disjoint domains, we view each as successive regimes of dynamics on ever-richer state spaces, stitched together by phase transitions, symmetry-breaking events, and emergent attractors. Starting from inflationary field dynamics and the growth of primordial perturbations, we describe how gravitational instability sculpts the cosmic web, how dissipative collapse in baryonic matter yields stars and planets, and how planetary-scale geochemical cycles define long-lived nonequilibrium attractors. Within these attractors, we frame the origin of life as the emergence of self-maintaining reaction networks, evolutionary biology as flow on high-dimensional genotype-phenotype-environment manifolds, and brains as adaptive dynamical systems operating near critical surfaces. Human culture and technology-including modern machine learning and artificial intelligence-are then interpreted as symbolic and institutional dynamics that implement and refine engineered learning flows which recursively reshape their own phase space. Throughout, we emphasize recurring mathematical motifs-instability, bifurcation, multiscale coupling, and constrained flows on measure-zero subsets of the accessible state space. Our aim is not to present any new cosmological or biological model, but a cross-scale, theoretical perspective: a way of reading the universe's history as the evolution of dynamics itself, culminating (so far) in biological and artificial systems capable of modeling, predicting, and deliberately perturbing their own future trajectories."}

Previous training-time defenses rely on adversarial fine-tuning, which requires labeled data and costly retraining, while existing test-time strategies fail to reliably distinguish between clean and adversarial inputs, thereby preventing both adversarial robustness and clean accuracy from reaching their optimum. To address these limitations, we propose Test-Time Padding (TTP), a lightweight defense framework that performs adversarial detection followed by targeted adaptation at inference. TTP identifies adversarial inputs via the cosine similarity shift between CLIP feature embeddings computed before and after spatial padding, yielding a universal threshold for reliable detection across architectures and datasets. For detected adversarial cases, TTP employs trainable padding to restore disrupted attention patterns, coupled with a similarity-aware ensemble strategy for a more robust final prediction. For clean inputs, TTP leaves them unchanged by default or optionally integrates existing test-time adaptation techniques for further accuracy gains. Comprehensive experiments on diverse CLIP backbones and fine-grained benchmarks show that TTP consistently surpasses state-of-the-art test-time defenses, delivering substantial improvements in adversarial robustness without compromising clean accuracy.

SLHF frames the alignment problem as a sequential-move game between two policies: a Leader, which commits to an action, and a Follower, which responds conditionally on the Leader's action. This approach decomposes preference optimization into a refinement problem for the Follower and an optimization problem against an adversary for the Leader. Unlike Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF), which assigns scalar rewards to actions, or Nash Learning from Human Feedback (NLHF), which seeks a simultaneous-move equilibrium, SLHF leverages the asymmetry of sequential play to capture richer preference structures. The sequential design of SLHF naturally enables inference-time refinement, as the Follower learns to improve the Leader's actions, and these refinements can be leveraged through iterative sampling. We compare the solution concepts of SLHF, RLHF, and NLHF, and lay out key advantages in consistency, data sensitivity, and robustness to intransitive preferences. Experiments on large language models demonstrate that SLHF achieves strong alignment across diverse preference datasets, scales from 0.5B to 8B parameters, and yields inference-time refinements that transfer across model families without further fine-tuning."}

Trained DNNs represent valuable assets, often developed through significant investments. However, the ease with which models can be copied, redistributed, or repurposed highlights the urgent need for effective mechanisms to assert and verify model ownership. In this work, we propose an efficient and resilient white-box watermarking framework that embeds ownership information into the internal parameters of a DNN using chaotic sequences. The watermark is generated using a logistic map, a well-known chaotic function, producing a sequence that is sensitive to its initialization parameters. This sequence is injected into the weights of a chosen intermediate layer without requiring structural modifications to the model or degradation in predictive performance. To validate ownership, we introduce a verification process based on a genetic algorithm that recovers the original chaotic parameters by optimizing the similarity between the extracted and regenerated sequences. The effectiveness of the proposed approach is demonstrated through extensive experiments on image classification tasks using MNIST and CIFAR-10 datasets. The results show that the embedded watermark remains detectable after fine-tuning, with negligible loss in model accuracy. In addition to numerical recovery of the watermark, we perform visual analyses using weight density plots and construct activation-based classifiers to distinguish between original, watermarked, and tampered models. Overall, the proposed method offers a flexible and scalable solution for embedding and verifying model ownership in white-box settings well-suited for real-world scenarios where IP protection is critical."}

This study examines how different forms of epistemic failure emerge, are masked, and are tolerated in human AI interaction, where failure is understood as a relational breakdown shaped by model-generated plausibility and human interpretive judgment. We conducted a three round, multi LLM evaluation using interdisciplinary tasks and progressively differentiated assessment frameworks to observe how evaluators interpret model responses across linguistic, epistemic, and credibility dimensions. Our findings show that LLM errors shift from predictive to hermeneutic forms, where linguistic fluency, structural coherence, and superficially plausible citations conceal deeper distortions of meaning. Evaluators frequently conflated criteria such as correctness, relevance, bias, groundedness, and consistency, indicating that human judgment collapses analytical distinctions into intuitive heuristics shaped by form and fluency. Across rounds, we observed a systematic verification burden and cognitive drift. As tasks became denser, evaluators increasingly relied on surface cues, allowing erroneous yet well formed answers to pass as credible. These results suggest that error is not solely a property of model behavior but a co-constructed outcome of generative plausibility and human interpretive shortcuts. Understanding AI epistemic failure therefore requires reframing evaluation as a relational interpretive process, where the boundary between system failure and human miscalibration becomes porous. The study provides implications for LLM assessment, digital literacy, and the design of trustworthy human AI communication."}

While existing NL-to-TL translation frameworks have demonstrated encouraging initial results, these systems either explicitly assume access to accurate atom grounding or suffer from low grounded translation accuracy. In this paper, we propose a framework for Grounding Natural Language Into System Signatures for Temporal Logic translation called GinSign. The framework introduces a grounding model that learns the abstract task of mapping NL spans onto a given system signature: given a lifted NL specification and a system signature $\\mathcal{S}$, the classifier must assign each lifted atomic proposition to an element of the set of signature-defined atoms $\\mathcal{P}$. We decompose the grounding task hierarchically -- first predicting predicate labels, then selecting the appropriately typed constant arguments. Decomposing this task from a free-form generation problem into a structured classification problem permits the use of smaller masked language models and eliminates the reliance on expensive LLMs. Experiments across multiple domains show that frameworks which omit grounding tend to produce syntactically correct lifted LTL that is semantically nonequivalent to grounded target expressions, whereas our framework supports downstream model checking and achieves grounded logical-equivalence scores of $95.5\\%$, a $1.4\\times$ improvement over SOTA."}

However, it is challenging to reconstruct realistic and diverse full-body poses based on sparse signals obtained by head-mounted displays, which are the main devices in AR/VR scenarios. Existing methods for pose reconstruction often incur high computational costs or rely on separately modeling spatial and temporal dependencies, making it difficult to balance accuracy, temporal coherence, and efficiency. To address this problem, we propose KineST, a novel kinematics-guided state space model, which effectively extracts spatiotemporal dependencies while integrating local and global pose perception. The innovation comes from two core ideas. Firstly, in order to better capture intricate joint relationships, the scanning strategy within the State Space Duality framework is reformulated into kinematics-guided bidirectional scanning, which embeds kinematic priors. Secondly, a mixed spatiotemporal representation learning approach is employed to tightly couple spatial and temporal contexts, balancing accuracy and smoothness. Additionally, a geometric angular velocity loss is introduced to impose physically meaningful constraints on rotational variations for further improving motion stability. Extensive experiments demonstrate that KineST has superior performance in both accuracy and temporal consistency within a lightweight framework. Project page: https://kaka-1314.github.io/KineST/"}

More precisely, the problem considers two key decisions: (i) whether to deploy additional edge servers or upgrade those already installed, and (ii) how tasks should be offloaded so that the average number of tasks that meet their delay requirement is maximized. The framework specifically involves: (i) deployment of new servers combined with capacity upgrades for existing servers, and (ii) the optimal task offloading to maximize the average number of tasks with a delay requirement. It also considers the following constraints: (i) budget per stage, (ii) server deployment and upgrade cost (in $) and cost depreciation rate, (iii) computation resource of servers, (iv) number of tasks and their growth rate (in %), and (v) the increase in task sizes and stricter delay requirements over time. We present two solutions: a Mixed Integer Linear Programming (MILP) model and an efficient heuristic algorithm (M-ESU/H). MILP yields the optimal solution for small networks, whereas M-ESU/H is used in large-scale networks. For small networks, the simulation results show that the solution computed by M-ESU/H is within 1.25% of the optimal solution while running several orders of magnitude faster. For large networks, M-ESU/H is compared against three alternative heuristic solutions that consider only server deployment, or giving priority to server deployment or upgrade. Our experiments show that M-ESU/H yields up to 21.57% improvement in task satisfaction under identical budget and demand growth conditions, confirming its scalability and practical value for long-term MEC systems."}

This paper presents a multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) framework based on the QMIX algorithm to improve the resilience of swarm communications under reactive jamming. We consider a network of multiple transmitter-receiver pairs sharing channels while a reactive jammer with Markovian threshold dynamics senses aggregate power and reacts accordingly. Each agent jointly selects transmit frequency (channel) and power, and QMIX learns a centralized but factorizable action-value function that enables coordinated yet decentralized execution. We benchmark QMIX against a genie-aided optimal policy in a no-channel-reuse setting, and against local Upper Confidence Bound (UCB) and a stateless reactive policy in a more general fading regime with channel reuse enabled. Simulation results show that QMIX rapidly converges to cooperative policies that nearly match the genie-aided bound, while achieving higher throughput and lower jamming incidence than the baselines, thereby demonstrating MARL's effectiveness for securing autonomous swarms in contested environments."}

State-of-the-art approaches decompose the task into a lifting of atomic propositions (APs) phase and a translation phase. However, existing methods struggle with accurate lifting, the existence of co-references, and learning from limited data. In this paper, we propose a framework for NL to TL translation called Grammar Forced Translation (GraFT). The framework is based on the observation that previous work solves both the lifting and translation steps by letting a language model iteratively predict tokens from its full vocabulary. In contrast, GraFT reduces the complexity of both tasks by restricting the set of valid output tokens from the full vocabulary to only a handful in each step. The solution space reduction is obtained by exploiting the unique properties of each problem. We also provide a theoretical justification for why the solution space reduction leads to more efficient learning. We evaluate the effectiveness of GraFT using the CW, GLTL, and Navi benchmarks. Compared with state-of-the-art translation approaches, it can be observed that GraFT the end-to-end translation accuracy by 5.49% and out-of-domain translation accuracy by 14.06% on average."}

Historically, many methodologies have tackled this challenge, but consistent real-time accuracy, especially in diverse environments, remains elusive. This study examines the performance of YOLOv8 variants on License Plate Recognition (LPR) and Character Recognition tasks, crucial for advancing Intelligent Transportation Systems. Two distinct datasets were employed for training and evaluation, yielding notable findings. The YOLOv8 Nano variant demonstrated a precision of 0.964 and mAP50 of 0.918 on the LPR task, while the YOLOv8 Small variant exhibited a precision of 0.92 and mAP50 of 0.91 on the Character Recognition task. A custom method for character sequencing was introduced, effectively sequencing the detected characters based on their x-axis positions. An optimized pipeline, utilizing YOLOv8 Nano for LPR and YOLOv8 Small for Character Recognition, is proposed. This configuration not only maintains computational efficiency but also ensures high accuracy, establishing a robust foundation for future real-world deployments on edge devices within Intelligent Transportation Systems.

However, the sensitive nature of data (e.g., eye-tracking) used in these systems raises significant privacy concerns, as adversaries can exploit these data and models to infer and leak personal information through membership inference attacks (MIA) and re-identification (RDA) with a high success rate. Researchers have proposed various techniques to mitigate such privacy attacks, including differential privacy (DP). However, AI XR datasets often contain numerous features, and applying DP uniformly can introduce unnecessary noise to less relevant features, degrade model accuracy, and increase inference time, limiting real-time XR deployment. Motivated by this, we propose a novel framework combining explainable AI (XAI) and DP-enabled privacy-preserving mechanisms to defend against privacy attacks. Specifically, we leverage post-hoc explanations to identify the most influential features in AI XR models and selectively apply DP to those features during inference. We evaluate our XAI-guided DP approach on three state-of-the-art AI XR models and three datasets: cybersickness, emotion, and activity classification. Our results show that the proposed method reduces MIA and RDA success rates by up to 43% and 39%, respectively, for cybersickness tasks while preserving model utility with up to 97% accuracy using Transformer models. Furthermore, it improves inference time by up to ~2x compared to traditional DP approaches. To demonstrate practicality, we deploy the XAI-guided DP AI XR models on an HTC VIVE Pro headset and develop a user interface (UI), namely PrivateXR, allowing users to adjust privacy levels (e.g., low, medium, high) while receiving real-time task predictions, protecting user privacy during XR gameplay."}

We argue that satisfying these constraints can lead to benchmark drift over time, where the static benchmark judges fail to keep up with newer model capabilities. We show that benchmark drift is a significant problem for GenEval, one of the most popular T2I benchmarks. Although GenEval was well-aligned with human judgment at the time of its release, it has drifted far from human judgment over time -- resulting in an absolute error of as much as 17.7% for current models. This level of drift strongly suggests that GenEval has been saturated for some time, as we verify via a large-scale human study. To help fill this benchmarking gap, we introduce a new benchmark, GenEval 2, with improved coverage of primitive visual concepts and higher degrees of compositionality, which we show is more challenging for current models. We also introduce Soft-TIFA, an evaluation method for GenEval 2 that combines judgments for visual primitives, which we show is more well-aligned with human judgment and argue is less likely to drift from human-alignment over time (as compared to more holistic judges such as VQAScore). Although we hope GenEval 2 will provide a strong benchmark for many years, avoiding benchmark drift is far from guaranteed and our work, more generally, highlights the importance of continual audits and improvement for T2I and related automated model evaluation benchmarks."}

This paper explores a key challenge of Online Edge ML: \"How to determine labels for truly future, unseen data points\". We propose Knowledge Transformation (KT), a hybrid method combining Knowledge Distillation, Active Learning, and causal reasoning. In short, KT acts as the oracle in active learning by transforming knowledge from a teacher model to generate pseudo-labels for training a student model. To verify the validity of the method, we conducted simulation experiments with two setups: (1) using a less stable teacher model and (2) a relatively more stable teacher model. Results indicate that when a stable teacher model is given, the student model can eventually reach its expected maximum performance. KT is potentially beneficial for scenarios that meet the following circumstances: (1) when the teacher's task is generic, which means existing pre-trained models might be adequate for its task, so there will be no need to train the teacher model from scratch; and/or (2) when the label for the student's task is difficult or expensive to acquire."}

This ability, known as Continual learning, provides a foundation for AI systems to develop themselves adaptively. Catastrophic forgetting is a major challenge to the progress of Continual Learning approaches, where learning a new task usually results in a dramatic performance drop on previously learned ones. Many approaches have emerged to counteract the impact of CF. Most of the proposed approaches can be categorized into five classes: replay-based, regularization-based, optimization-based, representation-based, and architecture-based. In this work, we approach the problem from a different angle, specifically by considering the optimal sequencing of tasks as they are presented to the model. We investigate the role of task sequencing in mitigating CF and propose a method for determining the optimal task order. The proposed method leverages zero-shot scoring algorithms inspired by neural architecture search (NAS). Results demonstrate that intelligent task sequencing can substantially reduce CF. Moreover, when combined with traditional continual learning strategies, sequencing offers enhanced performance and robustness against forgetting. Additionally, the presented approaches can find applications in other fields, such as curriculum learning."}

However, training state-of-the-art models remains notoriously difficult, with current approaches often struggling to balance robustness against true imperceptibility. This work introduces Pixel Seal, which sets a new state-of-the-art for image and video watermarking. We first identify three fundamental issues of existing methods: (i) the reliance on proxy perceptual losses such as MSE and LPIPS that fail to mimic human perception and result in visible watermark artifacts; (ii) the optimization instability caused by conflicting objectives, which necessitates exhaustive hyperparameter tuning; and (iii) reduced robustness and imperceptibility of watermarks when scaling models to high-resolution images and videos. To overcome these issues, we first propose an adversarial-only training paradigm that eliminates unreliable pixel-wise imperceptibility losses. Second, we introduce a three-stage training schedule that stabilizes convergence by decoupling robustness and imperceptibility. Third, we address the resolution gap via high-resolution adaptation, employing JND-based attenuation and training-time inference simulation to eliminate upscaling artifacts. We thoroughly evaluate the robustness and imperceptibility of Pixel Seal on different image types and across a wide range of transformations, and show clear improvements over the state-of-the-art. We finally demonstrate that the model efficiently adapts to video via temporal watermark pooling, positioning Pixel Seal as a practical and scalable solution for reliable provenance in real-world image and video settings."}

Attempts to expand sampling across hospitals, institutions, or countries with differing regulations face severe privacy, regulatory, and logistical obstacles that are often difficult to overcome. The Federated Learning (FL) provides a promising solution by enabling collaborative model training across decentralized datasets while keeping patient data local and private. Here, we report a novel global FL initiative using the Sherpa.ai FL platform, which leverages FL across distributed datasets in two international organizations for the diagnosis of COL6-RD, using collagen VI immunofluorescence microscopy images from patient-derived fibroblast cultures. Our solution resulted in an ML model capable of classifying collagen VI patient images into the three primary pathogenic mechanism groups associated with COL6-RD: exon skipping, glycine substitution, and pseudoexon insertion. This new approach achieved an F1-score of 0.82, outperforming single-organization models (0.57-0.75). These results demonstrate that FL substantially improves diagnostic utility and generalizability compared to isolated institutional models.

However, deploying VLLMs for downstream tasks such as video recommendation remains challenging, since real systems require multi-video inputs, lightweight backbones, low-latency sequential inference, and rapid response. In practice, (1) decode-only generation yields high latency for sequential inference, (2) typical interfaces do not support multi-video inputs, and (3) constraining outputs to language discards fine-grained visual details that matter for downstream vision tasks. We argue that these limitations stem from the absence of a representation that preserves pixel-level detail while leveraging world knowledge. We present LinkedOut, a representation that extracts VLLM world knowledge directly from video to enable fast inference, supports multi-video histories, and removes the language bottleneck. LinkedOut extracts semantically grounded, knowledge-aware tokens from raw frames using VLLMs, guided by promptable queries and optional auxiliary modalities. We introduce a cross-layer knowledge fusion MoE that selects the appropriate level of abstraction from the rich VLLM features, enabling personalized, interpretable, and low-latency recommendation. To our knowledge, LinkedOut is the first VLLM-based video recommendation method that operates on raw frames without handcrafted labels, achieving state-of-the-art results on standard benchmarks.

This finetuning step has proved critical in achieving human or super-human performance, yet while much attention has been given to developing more effective finetuning algorithms, little attention has been given to ensuring the pretrained policy is an effective initialization for RL finetuning. In this work we seek to understand how the pretrained policy affects finetuning performance, and how to pretrain policies in order to ensure they are effective initializations for finetuning. We first show theoretically that standard behavioral cloning (BC) -- which trains a policy to directly match the actions played by the demonstrator -- can fail to ensure coverage over the demonstrator's actions, a minimal condition necessary for effective RL finetuning. We then show that if, instead of exactly fitting the observed demonstrations, we train a policy to model the posterior distribution of the demonstrator's behavior given the demonstration dataset, we do obtain a policy that ensures coverage over the demonstrator's actions, enabling more effective finetuning. Furthermore, this policy -- which we refer to as the posterior behavioral cloning (PostBC) policy -- achieves this while ensuring pretrained performance is no worse than that of the BC policy. We then show that PostBC is practically implementable with modern generative models in robotic control domains -- relying only on standard supervised learning -- and leads to significantly improved RL finetuning performance on both realistic robotic control benchmarks and real-world robotic manipulation tasks, as compared to standard behavioral cloning."}

Recent studies suggest that RLVR can elicit strong mathematical reasoning in LLMs through two seemingly paradoxical mechanisms: spurious rewards, which suppress exploitation by rewarding outcomes unrelated to the ground truth, and entropy minimization, which suppresses exploration by pushing the model toward more confident and deterministic outputs, highlighting a puzzling dynamic: both discouraging exploitation and discouraging exploration improve reasoning performance, yet the underlying principles that reconcile these effects remain poorly understood. We focus on two fundamental questions: (i) how policy entropy relates to performance, and (ii) whether spurious rewards yield gains, potentially through the interplay of clipping bias and model contamination. Our results show that clipping bias under spurious rewards reduces policy entropy, leading to more confident and deterministic outputs, while entropy minimization alone is insufficient for improvement. We further propose a reward-misalignment model explaining why spurious rewards can enhance performance beyond contaminated settings. Our findings clarify the mechanisms behind spurious-reward benefits and provide principles for more effective RLVR training."}

We first extract visual features for each image using a DINO backbone, and employ alternating intra-view local attention, cross-view spatial attention, and cross-frame temporal attention to infer geometric relations across images.

On the model side, we observe that pretrained text-to-video models possess editing capability, motivating a simplified design. Simple sequence concatenation for conditioning with light LoRA fine-tuning suffices to train a strong model. For control, we unify spatiotemporal control via a single mask mechanism and support optional reference images. Overall, EasyV2V works with flexible inputs, e.g., video+text, video+mask+text, video+mask+reference+text, and achieves state-of-the-art video editing results, surpassing concurrent and commercial systems.

To address this, we introduce AuditDM, an automated framework that actively discovers and rectifies MLLM failure modes by auditing their divergence. AuditDM fine-tunes an MLLM as an auditor via reinforcement learning to generate challenging questions and counterfactual images that maximize disagreement among target models. Once trained, the auditor uncovers diverse, interpretable exemplars that reveal model weaknesses and serve as annotation-free data for rectification. When applied to SoTA models like Gemma-3 and PaliGemma-2, AuditDM discovers more than 20 distinct failure types. Fine-tuning on these discoveries consistently improves all models across 16 benchmarks, and enables a 3B model to surpass its 28B counterpart. Our results suggest that as data scaling hits diminishing returns, targeted model auditing offers an effective path to model diagnosis and improvement."}
