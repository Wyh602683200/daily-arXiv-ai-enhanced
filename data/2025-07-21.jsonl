While recent advances in LLMs show\npromise for code generation, current SOTA models (e.g. R1, o1) achieve low\nsuccess rates in improving CUDA speed. In this paper, we introduce CUDA-L1, an\nautomated reinforcement learning framework for CUDA optimization.\n  CUDA-L1 achieves performance improvements on the CUDA optimization task:\ntrained on NVIDIA A100, it delivers an average speedup of x17.7 across all 250\nCUDA kernels of KernelBench, with peak speedups reaching x449. Furthermore, the\nmodel also demonstrates excellent portability across GPU architectures,\nachieving average speedups of x17.8 on H100, x19.0 on RTX 3090, x16.5 on L40,\nx14.7 on H800, and x13.9 on H20 despite being optimized specifically for A100.\nBeyond these benchmark results, CUDA-L1 demonstrates several remarkable\nproperties: 1) Discovers a variety of CUDA optimization techniques and learns\nto combine them strategically to achieve optimal performance; 2) Uncovers\nfundamental principles of CUDA optimization; 3) Identifies non-obvious\nperformance bottlenecks and rejects seemingly beneficial optimizations that\nharm performance.\n  The capabilities of CUDA-L1 demonstrate that reinforcement learning can\ntransform an initially poor-performing LLM into an effective CUDA optimizer\nthrough speedup-based reward signals alone, without human expertise or domain\nknowledge. More importantly, the trained RL model extend the acquired reasoning\nabilities to new kernels. This paradigm opens possibilities for automated\noptimization of CUDA operations, and holds promise to substantially promote GPU\nefficiency and alleviate the rising pressure on GPU computing resources."}

Studies report up to 10% of such\nfractures may be missed by radiologists. AI-driven tools offer a scalable way\nto assist early detection and reduce diagnostic delays. We address this gap\nthrough a dedicated AI system for shoulder radiographs. Methods: We developed a\nmulti-model deep learning system using 10,000 annotated shoulder X-rays.\nArchitectures include Faster R-CNN (ResNet50-FPN, ResNeXt), EfficientDet, and\nRF-DETR. To enhance detection, we applied bounding box and classification-level\nensemble techniques such as Soft-NMS, WBF, and NMW fusion.

Traditional clinical rating scales, though validated, are\nresource-intensive and lack scalability. Automated speech analysis with\nautomatic speech recognition (ASR) allows for objective quantification of\nlinguistic and temporal features of speech, offering scalable alternatives. The\nuse of utterance timestamps in ASR captures pause dynamics, which are thought\nto reflect the cognitive processes underlying speech production. However, the\nutility of integrating these ASR-derived features for assessing FTD severity\nrequires further evaluation. This study integrates pause features with semantic\ncoherence metrics across three datasets: naturalistic self-recorded diaries\n(AVH, n = 140), structured picture descriptions (TOPSY, n = 72), and dream\nnarratives (PsyCL, n = 43). We evaluated pause related features alongside\nestablished coherence measures, using support vector regression (SVR) to\npredict clinical FTD scores. Key findings demonstrate that pause features alone\nrobustly predict the severity of FTD. Integrating pause features with semantic\ncoherence metrics enhanced predictive performance compared to semantic-only\nmodels, with integration of independent models achieving correlations up to\n\\r{ho} = 0.649 and AUC = 83.71% for severe cases detection (TOPSY, with best\n\\r{ho} = 0.584 and AUC = 79.23% for semantic-only models). The performance\ngains from semantic and pause features integration held consistently across all\ncontexts, though the nature of pause patterns was dataset-dependent. These\nfindings suggest that frameworks combining temporal and semantic analyses\nprovide a roadmap for refining the assessment of disorganized speech and\nadvance automated speech analysis in psychosis."}

Both regimes rely on feedback\nloops that decode internal states into tokens only to re-encode them in\nsubsequent steps. While this \"thinking aloud\" mirrors human reasoning,\nbiological brains iterate without externalising intermediate states as\nlanguage. To boost the expressive power of encoder Transformers without\nresorting to token-level autoregression, we introduce the SELF-Transformer: an\nencoder layer that iteratively refines its own attention weights to a fixed\npoint. Instead of producing -- in one pass -- the alignment matrix that remixes\nthe input sequence, the SELF-Transformer iteratively updates that matrix\ninternally, scaling test-time computation with input difficulty.

This heterogeneity\nposes significant challenges for feature fusion and perception reliability. To\naddress these issues, we propose HeCoFuse, a unified framework designed for\ncooperative perception across mixed sensor setups where nodes may carry Cameras\n(C), LiDARs (L), or both. By introducing a hierarchical fusion mechanism that\nadaptively weights features through a combination of channel-wise and spatial\nattention, HeCoFuse can tackle critical challenges such as cross-modality\nfeature misalignment and imbalanced representation quality. In addition, an\nadaptive spatial resolution adjustment module is employed to balance\ncomputational cost and fusion effectiveness. To enhance robustness across\ndifferent configurations, we further implement a cooperative learning strategy\nthat dynamically adjusts fusion type based on available modalities. Experiments\non the real-world TUMTraf-V2X dataset demonstrate that HeCoFuse achieves 43.22%\n3D mAP under the full sensor configuration (LC+LC), outperforming the CoopDet3D\nbaseline by 1.17%, and reaches an even higher 43.38% 3D mAP in the L+LC\nscenario, while maintaining 3D mAP in the range of 21.74% to 43.38% across nine\nheterogeneous sensor configurations.

In contrast, the\ndataset contains a diverse array of other note types, each capturing different\naspects of care.\n  We present DENSE (Documenting Evolving Progress Notes from Scattered\nEvidence), a system designed to align with clinical documentation workflows by\nsimulating how physicians reference past encounters while drafting progress\nnotes. The system introduces a fine-grained note categorization and a temporal\nalignment mechanism that organizes heterogeneous notes across visits into\nstructured, chronological inputs. At its core, DENSE leverages a clinically\ninformed retrieval strategy to identify temporally and semantically relevant\ncontent from both current and prior visits. This retrieved evidence is used to\nprompt a large language model (LLM) to generate clinically coherent and\ntemporally aware progress notes.\n  We evaluate DENSE on a curated cohort of patients with multiple visits and\ncomplete progress note documentation. The generated notes demonstrate strong\nlongitudinal fidelity, achieving a temporal alignment ratio of $1.089$,\nsurpassing the continuity observed in original notes. By restoring narrative\ncoherence across fragmented documentation, our system supports improved\ndownstream tasks such as summarization, predictive modeling, and clinical\ndecision support, offering a scalable solution for LLM-driven note synthesis in\nreal-world healthcare settings."}

Possessing awareness of event memorability for a\nuser could help intelligent systems in more accurate user modelling, especially\nfor such applications as meeting support systems, memory augmentation, and\nmeeting summarisation. Emotion recognition has been widely studied, since\nemotions are thought to signal moments of high personal relevance to users. The\nemotional experience of situations and their memorability have traditionally\nbeen considered to be closely tied to one another: moments that are experienced\nas highly emotional are considered to also be highly memorable. This\nrelationship suggests that emotional annotations could serve as proxies for\nmemorability. However, existing emotion recognition systems rely heavily on\nthird-party annotations, which may not accurately represent the first-person\nexperience of emotional relevance and memorability. This is why, in this study,\nwe empirically examine the relationship between perceived group emotions\n(Pleasure-Arousal) and group memorability in the context of conversational\ninteractions. Our investigation involves continuous time-based annotations of\nboth emotions and memorability in dynamic, unstructured group settings,\napproximating conditions of real-world conversational AI applications such as\nonline meeting support systems. Our results show that the observed relationship\nbetween affect and memorability annotations cannot be reliably distinguished\nfrom what might be expected under random chance. We discuss the implications of\nthis surprising finding for the development and applications of Affective\nComputing technology. In addition, we contextualise our findings in broader\ndiscourses in the Affective Computing and point out important targets for\nfuture research efforts."}

However, their unpredictability,\ncombined with the high potential for harm in this domain, means rigorous\nevaluation is necessary. Our goals with this track were to stimulate research\nand to provide high-quality evaluation of the most promising systems.\n  Methods: We hosted the Plain Language Adaptation of Biomedical Abstracts\n(PLABA) track at the 2023 and 2024 Text Retrieval Conferences. Tasks included\ncomplete, sentence-level, rewriting of abstracts (Task 1) as well as\nidentifying and replacing difficult terms (Task 2). For automatic evaluation of\nTask 1, we developed a four-fold set of professionally-written references.\nSubmissions for both Tasks 1 and 2 were provided extensive manual evaluation\nfrom biomedical experts.\n  Results: Twelve teams spanning twelve countries participated in the track,\nwith models from multilayer perceptrons to large pretrained transformers. In\nmanual judgments of Task 1, top-performing models rivaled human levels of\nfactual accuracy and completeness, but not simplicity or brevity. Automatic,\nreference-based metrics generally did not correlate well with manual judgments.\nIn Task 2, systems struggled with identifying difficult terms and classifying\nhow to replace them. When generating replacements, however, LLM-based systems\ndid well in manually judged accuracy, completeness, and simplicity, though not\nin brevity.\n  Conclusion: The PLABA track showed promise for using Large Language Models to\nadapt biomedical literature for the general public, while also highlighting\ntheir deficiencies and the need for improved automatic benchmarking tools."}

Their\nsupervised training requires millions of triplets: original image, instruction,\nedited image. Yet mining pixel-accurate examples is hard. Each edit must affect\nonly prompt-specified regions, preserve stylistic coherence, respect physical\nplausibility, and retain visual appeal. The lack of robust automated\nedit-quality metrics hinders reliable automation at scale. We present an\nautomated, modular pipeline that mines high-fidelity triplets across domains,\nresolutions, instruction complexities, and styles. Built on public generative\nmodels and running without human intervention, our system uses a task-tuned\nGemini validator to score instruction adherence and aesthetics directly,\nremoving any need for segmentation or grounding models.

By automating the most\nrepetitive annotation steps, the approach allows a new scale of training\nwithout human labeling effort. To democratize research in this\nresource-intensive area, we release NHR-Edit: an open dataset of 358k\nhigh-quality triplets.

We observe\nthat KANs can inherently perform well on raw imbalanced data more effectively\nthan Multi-Layer Perceptrons (MLPs) without any resampling strategy. However,\nconventional imbalance strategies fundamentally conflict with KANs mathematical\nstructure as resampling and focal loss implementations significantly degrade\nKANs performance, while marginally benefiting MLPs. Crucially, KANs suffer from\nprohibitive computational costs without proportional performance gains.\nStatistical validation confirms that MLPs with imbalance techniques achieve\nequivalence with KANs (|d| < 0.08 across metrics) at minimal resource costs.\nThese findings reveal that KANs represent a specialized solution for raw\nimbalanced data where resources permit. But their severe performance-resource\ntradeoffs and incompatibility with standard resampling techniques currently\nlimits practical deployment.

However, in many real-world applications, data are\nhigh-dimensional with varying input lengths and naturally take the form of\nirregular tensors. To analyze such data, irregular tensor decomposition is\ncritical for extracting meaningful clusters that capture essential information.\nIn this paper, we focus on modeling causal representation learning based on the\ntransformed information. First, we present a novel causal formulation for a set\nof latent clusters. We then propose CaRTeD, a joint learning framework that\nintegrates temporal causal representation learning with irregular tensor\ndecomposition. Notably, our framework provides a blueprint for downstream tasks\nusing the learned tensor factors, such as modeling latent structures and\nextracting causal information, and offers a more flexible regularization design\nto enhance tensor decomposition. Theoretically, we show that our algorithm\nconverges to a stationary point. More importantly, our results fill the gap in\ntheoretical guarantees for the convergence of state-of-the-art irregular tensor\ndecomposition. Experimental results on synthetic and real-world electronic\nhealth record (EHR) datasets (MIMIC-III), with extensive benchmarks from both\nphenotyping and network recovery perspectives, demonstrate that our proposed\nmethod outperforms state-of-the-art techniques and enhances the explainability\nof causal representations."}
