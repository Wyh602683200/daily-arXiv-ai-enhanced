Experiments on public multimodal benchmarks confirm that MultiSHAP\nfaithfully captures cross-modal reasoning mechanisms, while real-world case\nstudies demonstrate its practical utility. Our framework is extensible beyond\ntwo modalities, offering a general solution for interpreting complex multimodal\nAI models."}

Such benchmarks do not represent the many forms of\npartial observability seen in real domains, like visual occlusion or unknown\nopponent intent. We argue that a partially observable benchmark should have two\nkey properties. The first is coverage in its forms of partial observability, to\nensure an algorithm's generalizability. The second is a large gap between the\nperformance of a agents with more or less state information, all other factors\nroughly equal. This gap implies that an environment is memory improvable: where\nperformance gains in a domain are from an algorithm's ability to cope with\npartial observability as opposed to other factors. We introduce best-practice\nguidelines for empirically benchmarking reinforcement learning under partial\nobservability, as well as the open-source library POBAX: Partially Observable\nBenchmarks in JAX. We characterize the types of partial observability present\nin various environments and select representative environments for our\nbenchmark. These environments include localization and mapping, visual control,\ngames, and more. Additionally, we show that these tasks are all memory\nimprovable and require hard-to-learn memory functions, providing a concrete\nsignal for partial observability research. This framework includes recommended\nhyperparameters as well as algorithm implementations for fast, out-of-the-box\nevaluation, as well as highly performant environments implemented in JAX for\nGPU-scalable experimentation."}

With the increasing proliferation of the Internet of\nThings (IoT) and smart manufacturing, time-series data has dramatically\nincreased in both scale and dimensionality. This growth has exposed the\nlimitations of traditional statistical methods in handling the high\nheterogeneity and complexity of such data. Inspired by the recent success of\nlarge language models (LLMs) in multimodal tasks across language and vision\ndomains, we propose a novel unsupervised anomaly detection framework: A\nTri-Branch Patch-wise Large Language Model Framework for Time-Series Anomaly\nDetection (TriP-LLM). TriP-LLM integrates local and global temporal features\nthrough a tri-branch design-Patching, Selection, and Global-to encode the input\ntime series into patch-wise tokens, which are then processed by a frozen,\npretrained LLM. A lightweight patch-wise decoder reconstructs the input, from\nwhich anomaly scores are derived. We evaluate TriP-LLM on several public\nbenchmark datasets using PATE, a recently proposed threshold-free evaluation\nmetric, and conduct all comparisons within a unified open-source framework to\nensure fairness. Experimental results show that TriP-LLM consistently\noutperforms recent state-of-the-art methods across all datasets, demonstrating\nstrong detection capabilities. Furthermore, through extensive ablation studies,\nwe verify the substantial contribution of the LLM to the overall architecture.\nCompared to LLM-based approaches using Channel Independence (CI) patch\nprocessing, TriP-LLM achieves significantly lower memory consumption, making it\nmore suitable for GPU memory-constrained environments.

BEMA is motivated by a simple theoretical model wherein we demonstrate\nprovable acceleration of BEMA over both a standard EMA and vanilla training.\nThrough an extensive suite of experiments on Language Models, we show that BEMA\nleads to significantly improved convergence rates and final performance over\nboth EMA and vanilla training in a variety of standard LM benchmarks, making\nBEMA a practical and theoretically motivated intervention for more stable and\nefficient fine-tuning."}

In contrast, baseline synonym words exhibit no\nsignificant directional shift.

At the same time, domain\nexperts in science and engineering may not possess such ML expertise and\ntraining while they are in pressing need of ML-based analytics. In this paper,\nwe present our ExeKGLib, a Python library enhanced with a graphical interface\nlayer that allows users with minimal ML knowledge to build ML pipelines. This\nis achieved by relying on knowledge graphs that encode ML knowledge in simple\nterms accessible to non-ML experts. ExeKGLib also allows improving the\ntransparency and reusability of the built ML workflows and ensures that they\nare executable. We show the usability and usefulness of ExeKGLib by presenting\nreal use cases."}

To\naddress this, we propose DAPT, an effective PT framework based on an intuitive\ndecouple-before-align concept. First, we propose to explicitly decouple the\nvisual modality into the foreground and background representation via\nexploiting coarse-and-fine visual segmenting cues, and then both of these\ndecoupled patterns are aligned with the original foreground texts and the\nhand-crafted background classes, thereby symmetrically strengthening the modal\nalignment.

We observe that: (1)\nearly denoising steps define the semantic layout of the image, and (2)\ncross-attention layers in U-Net are crucial for aligning text and image\nregions. Based on these insights, we propose Wukong, a transformer-based NSFW\ndetection framework that leverages intermediate outputs from early denoising\nsteps and reuses U-Net's pre-trained cross-attention parameters. Wukong\noperates within the diffusion process, enabling early detection without waiting\nfor full image generation. We also introduce a new dataset containing prompts,\nseeds, and image-specific NSFW labels, and evaluate Wukong on this and two\npublic benchmarks.

Agentic retrieval significantly improved mean diagnostic\naccuracy over zero-shot prompting (73% vs. 64%; P<0.001) and conventional\nonline RAG (73% vs. 68%; P<0.001). The greatest gains occurred in mid-sized\nmodels (e.g., Mistral Large improved from 72% to 81%) and small-scale models\n(e.g., Qwen 2.5-7B improved from 55% to 71%), while very large models (>200B\nparameters) demonstrated minimal changes (<2% improvement). Additionally,\nagentic retrieval reduced hallucinations (mean 9.4%) and retrieved clinically\nrelevant context in 46% of cases, substantially aiding factual grounding. Even\nclinically fine-tuned models exhibited meaningful improvements (e.g.,\nMedGemma-27B improved from 71% to 81%), indicating complementary roles of\nretrieval and fine-tuning. These results highlight the potential of agentic\nframeworks to enhance factuality and diagnostic accuracy in radiology QA,\nparticularly among mid-sized LLMs, warranting future studies to validate their\nclinical utility."}

Exploring Biometric Verification Scenarios in Photorealistic Talking-Head Avatar Videos", "categories": ["cs.CV", "cs.AI", "cs.CR", "cs.MM"], "comment": "Accepted at the IEEE International Joint Conference on Biometrics\n  (IJCB 2025)", "summary": "Photorealistic talking-head avatars are becoming increasingly common in\nvirtual meetings, gaming, and social platforms. These avatars allow for more\nimmersive communication, but they also introduce serious security risks. One\nemerging threat is impersonation: an attacker can steal a user's\navatar-preserving their appearance and voice-making it nearly impossible to\ndetect its fraudulent usage by sight or sound alone. In this paper, we explore\nthe challenge of biometric verification in such avatar-mediated scenarios. Our\nmain question is whether an individual's facial motion patterns can serve as\nreliable behavioral biometrics to verify their identity when the avatar's\nvisual appearance is a facsimile of its owner. To answer this question, we\nintroduce a new dataset of realistic avatar videos created using a\nstate-of-the-art one-shot avatar generation model, GAGAvatar, with genuine and\nimpostor avatar videos. We also propose a lightweight, explainable\nspatio-temporal Graph Convolutional Network architecture with temporal\nattention pooling, that uses only facial landmarks to model dynamic facial\ngestures. Experimental results demonstrate that facial motion cues enable\nmeaningful identity verification with AUC values approaching 80%. The proposed\nbenchmark and biometric system are available for the research community in\norder to bring attention to the urgent need for more advanced behavioral\nbiometric defenses in avatar-based communication systems."}

It enables online platforms to create\nuser-friendly features that drive commercial success in a steady and effective\nmanner. The online environment is particularly conducive to applying causal\ninference techniques, such as randomized controlled experiments (known as A/B\ntest), which are often more challenging to implement in fields like medicine\nand public policy. However, businesses face unique challenges when it comes to\neffective A/B test. Specifically, achieving sufficient statistical power for\nconversion-based metrics can be time-consuming, especially for significant\npurchases like booking accommodations. While offline evaluations are quicker\nand more cost-effective, they often lack accuracy and are inadequate for\nselecting candidates for A/B test. To address these challenges, we developed\ninterleaving and counterfactual evaluation methods to facilitate rapid online\nassessments for identifying the most promising candidates for A/B tests. Our\napproach not only increased the sensitivity of experiments by a factor of up to\n100 (depending on the approach and metrics) compared to traditional A/B testing\nbut also streamlined the experimental process.

Although large\nlanguage models (LLMs) have recently improved hate speech detection\ncapabilities, the majority of existing work has concentrated on English\ndatasets, with limited attention given to multimodal strategies in the Chinese\ncontext. In this study, we propose MMBERT, a novel BERT-based multimodal\nframework that integrates textual, speech, and visual modalities through a\nMixture-of-Experts (MoE) architecture. To address the instability associated\nwith directly integrating MoE into BERT-based models, we develop a progressive\nthree-stage training paradigm. MMBERT incorporates modality-specific experts, a\nshared self-attention mechanism, and a router-based expert allocation strategy\nto enhance robustness against adversarial perturbations.

However, existing approaches predominantly focus on exploring\nsemantic information, such as the classes of sounding sources present in the\naudio, limiting their ability to generate videos with accurate content and\nspatial composition. In contrast, we humans can not only naturally identify the\nsemantic categories of sounding sources but also determine their deeply encoded\nspatial attributes, including locations and movement directions. This useful\ninformation can be elucidated by considering specific spatial indicators\nderived from the inherent physical properties of sound, such as loudness or\nfrequency. As prior methods largely ignore this factor, we present SpA2V, the\nfirst framework explicitly exploits these spatial auditory cues from audios to\ngenerate videos with high semantic and spatial correspondence. SpA2V decomposes\nthe generation process into two stages: 1) Audio-guided Video Planning: We\nmeticulously adapt a state-of-the-art MLLM for a novel task of harnessing\nspatial and semantic cues from input audio to construct Video Scene Layouts\n(VSLs). This serves as an intermediate representation to bridge the gap between\nthe audio and video modalities. 2) Layout-grounded Video Generation: We develop\nan efficient and effective approach to seamlessly integrate VSLs as conditional\nguidance into pre-trained diffusion models, enabling VSL-grounded video\ngeneration in a training-free manner.
