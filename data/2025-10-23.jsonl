The effect of verification manifests\nthrough interactions of three quantities: (i) the generator's coverage, (ii)\nthe verifier's region of convergence (ROC), and (iii) the sampling algorithm's\nsub-optimality. Though recent studies capture subsets of these factors, a\nunified framework quantifying the geometry of their interplay is missing. We\nframe verifiable test-time scaling as a transport problem. This characterizes\nthe interaction of coverage, ROC, and sub-optimality, and uncovers that the\nsub-optimality--coverage curve exhibits three regimes. A transport regime --\nwhere sub-optimality increases with coverage, a policy improvement regime --\nwhere sub-optimality may decrease with coverage, depending on the verifier's\nROC, and a saturation regime -- where sub-optimality plateaus, unaffected by\ncoverage.

This creates a need for frameworks and approaches that are\ncapable of taking advantage of on-device hardware. The MLX framework was\ncreated to address this need. It is a framework optimized for machine learning\n(ML) computations on Apple silicon devices, facilitating easier research,\nexperimentation, and prototyping.\n  This paper presents a performance evaluation of MLX, focusing on inference\nlatency of transformer models. We compare the performance of different\ntransformer architecture implementations in MLX with their Pytorch\ncounterparts. For this research we create a framework called MLX-transformers\nwhich includes different transformer implementations in MLX and downloads the\nmodel checkpoints in pytorch and converts it to the MLX format. By leveraging\nthe advanced architecture and capabilities of Apple Silicon, MLX-Transformers\nenables seamless execution of transformer models directly sourced from Hugging\nFace, eliminating the need for checkpoint conversion often required when\nporting models between frameworks.\n  Our study benchmarks different transformer models on two Apple Silicon\nmacbook devices against an NVIDIA CUDA GPU. Specifically, we compare the\ninference latency performance of models with the same parameter sizes and\ncheckpoints. We evaluate the performance of BERT, RoBERTa, and XLM-RoBERTa\nmodels, with the intention of extending future work to include models of\ndifferent modalities, thus providing a more comprehensive assessment of MLX's\ncapabilities. The results highlight MLX's potential in enabling efficient and\nmore accessible on-device ML applications within Apple's ecosystem."}

This paper systematically argues that the\nfield of statistics provides the indispensable foundation for machine learning\nand modern AI. We deconstruct AI into nine foundational pillars-Inference,\nDensity Estimation, Sequential Learning, Generalization, Representation\nLearning, Interpretability, Causality, Optimization, and\nUnification-demonstrating that each is built upon century-old statistical\nprinciples. From the inferential frameworks of hypothesis testing and\nestimation that underpin model evaluation, to the density estimation roots of\nclustering and generative AI; from the time-series analysis inspiring recurrent\nnetworks to the causal models that promise true understanding, we trace an\nunbroken statistical lineage. While celebrating the computational engines that\npower modern AI, we contend that statistics provides the brain-the theoretical\nframeworks, uncertainty quantification, and inferential goals-while computer\nscience provides the brawn-the scalable algorithms and hardware. Recognizing\nthis statistical backbone is not merely an academic exercise, but a necessary\nstep for developing more robust, interpretable, and trustworthy intelligent\nsystems. We issue a call to action for education, research, and practice to\nre-embrace this statistical foundation. Ignoring these roots risks building a\nfragile future; embracing them is the path to truly intelligent machines. There\nis no machine learning without statistical learning; no artificial intelligence\nwithout statistical thought."}

Specifically, existing EP optimizations\nattempt to overlap data communication and computation, which has little benefit\nin low-bandwidth scenarios due to a much longer data communication time.\nTherefore, the trends of cross-DC EP scaling is fast becoming a critical\nroadblock to the continued growth of MoE models.\n  To address this, we propose HybridEP, a modeling-guided framework to optimize\nEP under constrained bandwidth.

This design enables a stronger focus on developing generative\nagents and evaluating their performance in transport decision-making processes.\nOver a simulated month, results show that agents not only make context-aware\ntransport decisions but also form habits over time.

This unprecedented volume of data\nintroduces novel challenges. Specifically, the access to the same sensor\nmodalities at both training and inference stages becomes increasingly complex\nbased on real-world constraints affecting remote sensing platforms.

For LLMs to be effective in the real world,\nthey too must critically evaluate content by factoring in the motivations of\nthe source -- for instance, weighing the credibility of claims made in a sales\npitch. In this paper, we undertake a comprehensive study of whether LLMs have\nthis capacity for motivational vigilance. We first employ controlled\nexperiments from cognitive science to verify that LLMs' behavior is consistent\nwith rational models of learning from motivated testimony, and find they\nsuccessfully discount information from biased sources in a human-like manner.\nWe then extend our evaluation to sponsored online adverts, a more naturalistic\nreflection of LLM agents' information ecosystems.

The design leverages GPU acceleration for throughput,\nserverless elasticity for cost reduction, and feature-mask interpretability for\nIL4/FIPS compliance. We conduct benchmarks on the HR, Adult, and BLS datasets,\ncomparing our approach against Spark and CPU baselines. Our results show that\nGPU pipelines achieve up to 4.5x higher throughput, 98x lower latency, and 90%\nlower cost per 1K inferences compared to Spark baselines, while compliance\nmechanisms add only ~5.7 ms latency with p99 < 22 ms. Interpretability remains\nstable under peak load, ensuring reliable auditability. Taken together, these\nfindings provide a compliance-aware benchmark, a reproducible Helm-packaged\nblueprint, and a decision framework that demonstrate the practicality of\nsecure, interpretable, and cost-efficient serverless GPU analytics for\nregulated enterprise and government settings."}
