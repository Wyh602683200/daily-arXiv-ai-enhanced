However, we observe that these reasoning paths tend to include\nsubstantial redundancy; analyzing attention patterns reveals that attention\nscores are widely scattered, particularly incorrect answers exhibit greater\nattention sparsity. In this paper, we demonstrate that deliberately removing\nthis redundancy in the reasoning process significantly improves performance\nthrough clear thinking, i.e., removing distraction. Specifically, we\nsystematically identify reasoning redundancy by measuring token-level attention\nscores to a special end-of-thinking token, which is appended to an explicit\ninstruction inserted to conclude each intermediate reasoning step. Furthermore,\nwe propose structure-aware pruning that prioritizes removing tokens in\nlow-contributing reasoning chunks over individual tokens. After evicting\nredundant tokens, we remove the injected end-of-thinking instruction, then\nresume the reasoning generation. We demonstrate that our method significantly\nimproves overall accuracy across reasoning-intensive benchmarks without any\ntraining involved. In particular, our method shows strong performance on\nchallenging mathematical competition benchmarks such as AIME and AMC, where\nreasoning redundancy is more prevalent."}

However, due\nto limited resources, it is impractical to place sensors at every location to\ndetect unexpected shifts. Therefore, it is necessary to develop an optimal\nsensor placement strategy that enables partial observability of the system\nwhile detecting anomalies as quickly as possible. Numerous approaches have been\nproposed to address this challenge; however, most existing methods consider\nonly variable correlations and neglect a crucial factor: Causality. Moreover,\nalthough a few techniques incorporate causal analysis, they rely on\ninterventions-artificially creating anomalies-to identify causal effects, which\nis impractical and might lead to catastrophic losses. In this paper, we\nintroduce a causality-informed deep Q-network (Causal DQ) approach for\npartially observable sensor placement in anomaly detection. By integrating\ncausal information at each stage of Q-network training, our method achieves\nfaster convergence and tighter theoretical error bounds. Furthermore, the\ntrained causal-informed Q-network significantly reduces the detection time for\nanomalies under various settings, demonstrating its effectiveness for sensor\nplacement in large-scale, real-world data streams. Beyond the current\nimplementation, our technique's fundamental insights can be applied to various\nreinforcement learning problems, opening up new possibilities for real-world\ncausality-informed machine learning methods in engineering applications."}

Among ML techniques, reinforcement learning\n(RL) is particularly suited for CPS due to its capacity to handle complex,\ndynamic environments where explicit models of interaction between system and\nenvironment are unavailable or difficult to construct. However, in\nsafety-critical applications, this learning process must not only be effective\nbut demonstrably safe. Safe-RL methods aim to address this by incorporating\nsafety constraints during learning, yet they fall short in providing systematic\nassurance across the RL lifecycle. The AMLAS methodology offers structured\nguidance for assuring the safety of supervised learning components, but it does\nnot directly apply to the unique challenges posed by RL. In this paper, we\nadapt AMLAS to provide a framework for generating assurance arguments for an\nRL-enabled system through an iterative process; AMLAS-RL.

In centralized FL, a central server collects and aggregates model\nupdates from multiple clients to build a shared model while preserving each\nclient's data privacy. Standard FL methods, such as Federated Averaging\n(FedAvg), assume that clients are independent, which can limit performance in\ntraffic prediction tasks where spatial relationships between clients are\nimportant. Federated Graph Learning methods can capture these dependencies\nduring server-side aggregation, but they often introduce significant\ncomputational overhead. In this paper, we propose a lightweight graph-aware FL\napproach that blends the simplicity of FedAvg with key ideas from graph\nlearning. Rather than training full models, our method applies basic\nneighbourhood aggregation principles to guide parameter updates, weighting\nclient models based on graph connectivity. This approach captures spatial\nrelationships effectively while remaining computationally efficient. We\nevaluate our method on two benchmark traffic datasets, METR-LA and PEMS-BAY,\nand show that it achieves competitive performance compared to standard\nbaselines and recent graph-based federated learning techniques."}

Lastly, social compatibility objectives are considered\nby minimizing disruption to surrounding vehicles and enhancing the\npredictability of AV behaviors, thereby ensuring human-friendly and\ncontext-adaptive lane-changing strategies. A human-in-the-loop experiment\nconducted in a highway on-ramp merging scenario validates our TGLD approach.\nResults show that AVs can effectively adjust strategies according to different\nHVs' trust levels and driving styles. Moreover, incorporating a trust mechanism\nsignificantly improves lane-changing efficiency, maintains safety, and\ncontributes to transparent and adaptive AV-HV interactions."}

In this\nwork, we investigate applying ReFT to complex reasoning tasks. However,\ndirectly using the native ReFT method, which modifies fixed representations at\nthe beginning and end of each layer, yields suboptimal performance, as these\nfixed-position representations have uncertain impact on the outputs. We observe\nthat, in complex reasoning tasks, there often exist certain critical\nrepresentations. These representations either integrate significant information\nfrom preceding layers or regulate subsequent layer representations. Through\nlayer-by-layer propagation, they exert a substantial influence on the final\noutput. Naturally, fine-tuning these critical representations has the potential\nto greatly enhance reasoning performance. Building upon these insights, we\npropose Critical Representation Fine-Tuning (CRFT), a novel method that\nidentifies and optimizes these critical representations through information\nflow analysis. CRFT operates within a supervised learning framework,\ndynamically optimizing critical representations in a low-rank linear subspace\nwhile freezing the base model.

To better aggregate knowledge from clients,\nensemble distillation, as a widely used and effective technique, is often\nemployed after global aggregation to enhance the performance of the global\nmodel. However, simply combining Hetero-FL and ensemble distillation does not\nalways yield promising results and can make the training process unstable. The\nreason is that existing methods primarily focus on logit distillation, which,\nwhile being model-agnostic with softmax predictions, fails to compensate for\nthe knowledge bias arising from heterogeneous models. To tackle this challenge,\nwe propose a stable and efficient Feature Distillation for model-heterogeneous\nFederated learning, dubbed FedFD, that can incorporate aligned feature\ninformation via orthogonal projection to integrate knowledge from heterogeneous\nmodels better. Specifically, a new feature-based ensemble federated knowledge\ndistillation paradigm is proposed. The global model on the server needs to\nmaintain a projection layer for each client-side model architecture to align\nthe features separately. Orthogonal techniques are employed to re-parameterize\nthe projection layer to mitigate knowledge bias from heterogeneous models and\nthus maximize the distilled knowledge. Extensive experiments show that FedFD\nachieves superior performance compared to state-of-the-art methods."}

However, these breakthroughs are mostly reported on the\nQwen2.5 model family and evaluated on well-known benchmarks such as MATH-500,\nAMC, and AIME, while failing to achieve similar gains on other models like\nLlama, which warrants further investigation.

As a result, results derived from these benchmarks may be\nunreliable. To address this, we introduce a generator that produces fully\nsynthetic arithmetic problems of arbitrary length and difficulty, yielding a\nclean dataset we call RandomCalculation.

To address this gap, we introduce CodeJudgeBench, a\nbenchmark explicitly designed to evaluate the performance of LLM-as-a-Judge\nmodels across three critical coding tasks: code generation, code repair, and\nunit test generation. Through comprehensive benchmarking of 26 LLM-as-a-Judge\nmodels, we find that recent thinking models significantly outperform\nnon-thinking models on our carefully designed code judging tasks. Notably, even\nrelatively small thinking models, such as Qwen3-8B, can outperform specially\ntrained LLM-as-a-Judge models up to 70B in size. Nevertheless, all models still\nexhibit significant randomness in their judgment of coding tasks. For pairwise\njudging tasks, simply changing the order in which responses are presented can\nsubstantially impact accuracy. In addition, when judging code and unit tests\nwritten by different LLMs, LLM-as-a-Judge models also show variance in\nperformance. This sensitivity raises concerns about the reliability and\nconsistency of LLM-as-a-Judge in coding scenarios. Lastly, we study optimal\nprompting strategies for LLM-as-a-Judge.

To capture the expressive, detailed nature of human heads,\nincluding skin furrowing and finer-scale facial movements, we propose to couple\nlocally-defined facial expressions with 3D Gaussian splatting to enable\ncreating ultra-high fidelity, expressive and photorealistic 3D head avatars. In\ncontrast to previous works that operate on a global expression space, we\ncondition our avatar's dynamics on patch-based local expression features and\nsynthesize 3D Gaussians at a patch level.

These anchors are then used to synthesize 3D Gaussians\non-the-fly, conditioned by patch-expressions and viewing direction. We employ\ncolor-based densification and progressive training to obtain high-quality\nresults and faster convergence for high resolution 3K training images.
