Traditional approaches often rely on predefined\nvalidity frames, which may not always be available or sufficient.

By evaluating whether surrogate models lead to equivalent decisions\ncompared to high-fidelity models, DOTechnique enables efficient identification\nof validity regions, even in the absence of explicit validity boundaries. The\napproach integrates domain constraints and symbolic reasoning to narrow the\nsearch space, enhancing computational efficiency.

This process is prone to errors and biases, such as the\nillusion of causality, in which people perceive a causal relationship between\ntwo variables despite lacking supporting evidence. This cognitive bias has been\nproposed to underlie many societal problems, including social prejudice,\nstereotype formation, misinformation, and superstitious thinking. In this work,\nwe examine whether large language models are prone to developing causal\nillusions when faced with a classic cognitive science paradigm: the contingency\njudgment task. To investigate this, we constructed a dataset of 1,000 null\ncontingency scenarios (in which the available information is not sufficient to\nestablish a causal relationship between variables) within medical contexts and\nprompted LLMs to evaluate the effectiveness of potential causes. Our findings\nshow that all evaluated models systematically inferred unwarranted causal\nrelationships, revealing a strong susceptibility to the illusion of causality.\nWhile there is ongoing debate about whether LLMs genuinely understand causality\nor merely reproduce causal language without true comprehension, our findings\nsupport the latter hypothesis and raise concerns about the use of language\nmodels in domains where accurate causal reasoning is essential for informed\ndecision-making."}

To address this challenge, we propose GuardSpace, a guardrail framework\nfor preserving safety alignment throughout fine-tuning, composed of two key\ncomponents: a safety-sensitive subspace and a harmful-resistant null space.\nFirst, we explicitly decompose pre-trained weights into safety-relevant and\nsafety-irrelevant components using covariance-preconditioned singular value\ndecomposition, and initialize low-rank adapters from the safety-irrelevant\nones, while freezing safety-relevant components to preserve their associated\nsafety mechanism. Second, we construct a null space projector that restricts\nadapter updates from altering safe outputs on harmful prompts, thereby\nmaintaining the original refusal behavior. Experiments with various pre-trained\nmodels on multiple downstream tasks demonstrate that GuardSpace achieves\nsuperior performance over existing methods.

In recent model\nmerging methods, task vector has become a fundamental building block, as it can\nencapsulate the residual information from finetuning.

Existing efforts in overcoming\nredundancy by randomly dropping elements in the parameter space involves\nrandomness and lacks knowledge awareness. To address these challenges, in this\nstudy, we propose Purifying TAsk Vectors (PAVE) in knowledge-aware subspace.\nConcretely, we sample some training examples from each task, and feed them into\ntheir corresponding fine-tuned models to acquire the covariance matrices before\nlinear layers. We then perform a context-oriented singular value decomposition,\nwhich accentuates the weight components most relevant to the target knowledge.\nAs a result, we can split fine-tuned model weights into task-relevant and\nredundant components in the knowledge-aware subspace, and purify the task\nvector by pruning the redundant components. To induce fair pruning efforts\nacross models, we further introduce a spectral rank allocation strategy by\noptimizing a normalized activated pruning error. The task vector purification\nby our method as a plug-and-play scheme is applicable across various task\nvector-based merging methods to improve their performance.

In our experiment, we queried 19 LLMs with\nprompts that requested 5 facts for each of 15 topics. We repeated this query\n100 times for each LLM, each time adding prompt context from a different\npersona selected from a subset of personas modeling the general population. We\nprocessed the responses into sentence embeddings, computed cross-persona cosine\nsimilarity, and computed the weighted average of cross-persona cosine\nsimilarity to calculate factual consistency scores. In 100-persona experiments,\nscores ranged from 0.9065 to 0.7896, and the mean was 0.8656, which we adopt as\na benchmark threshold. xAI's Grok-3 is most consistent, while several\nlightweight models rank lowest. Consistency varies by topic: the job market is\nleast consistent, G7 world leaders most consistent, and issues like vaccines or\nthe Israeli-Palestinian conflict diverge by provider. These results show that\nboth the provider and the topic shape the factual consistency. We release our\ncode and interactive demo to support reproducible evaluation and encourage\npersona-invariant prompting strategies."}

However, much of this work has focused on\npublicly available datasets, such as Fiben, Spider, and Bird. Our earlier work\nshowed that LLMs are much less effective in querying large private enterprise\ndata warehouses and released Beaver, the first private enterprise text-to-SQL\nbenchmark. To create Beaver, we leveraged SQL logs, which are often readily\navailable. However, manually annotating these logs to identify which natural\nlanguage questions they answer is a daunting task. Asking database\nadministrators, who are highly trained experts, to take on additional work to\nconstruct and validate corresponding natural language utterances is not only\nchallenging but also quite costly. To address this challenge, we introduce\nBenchPress, a human-in-the-loop system designed to accelerate the creation of\ndomain-specific text-to-SQL benchmarks. Given a SQL query, BenchPress uses\nretrieval-augmented generation (RAG) and LLMs to propose multiple natural\nlanguage descriptions. Human experts then select, rank, or edit these drafts to\nensure accuracy and domain alignment. We evaluated BenchPress on annotated\nenterprise SQL logs, demonstrating that LLM-assisted annotation drastically\nreduces the time and effort required to create high-quality benchmarks.

In light of this, we\npropose CoRE, a plug-and-play technique that harnesses model consistency for\nrobust LLM ensemble, which can be seamlessly integrated with diverse ensemble\nmethods.

To achieve this,\nwe analyzed two semesters' worth of 16,986 conversational turns exchanged\nbetween PyTutor, an LLM-powered AI tutor, and 261 undergraduate learners across\nthree U.S. institutions. To investigate learners' emotional experiences, we\ngenerate zero-shot affect annotations from three frontier LLMs (Gemini, GPT-4o,\nClaude), including scalar ratings of valence, arousal, and\nlearning-helpfulness, along with free-text emotion labels. These estimates are\nfused through rank-weighted intra-model pooling and plurality consensus across\nmodels to produce robust emotion profiles. Our analysis shows that during\ninteraction with the AI tutor, students typically report mildly positive affect\nand moderate arousal. Yet learning is not uniformly smooth: confusion and\ncuriosity are frequent companions to problem solving, and frustration, while\nless common, still surfaces in ways that can derail progress. Emotional states\nare short-lived--positive moments last slightly longer than neutral or negative\nones, but they are fragile and easily disrupted.

Hallucination and inflation ratios\nreveal that models frequently overproduce categories relative to human\nannotators. Among the evaluated systems, Gemini 1.5/2.0 Flash and GPT 20B/120B\noffered the most favorable cost-to-performance balance, while GPT 120B\ndemonstrated the lowest hallucination ratio.

We present the first\nsystematic analysis of poisoning risks in LLM-based prompt optimization. Using\nHarmBench, we find systems are substantially more vulnerable to manipulated\nfeedback than to injected queries: feedback-based attacks raise attack success\nrate (ASR) by up to $\\Delta$ASR = 0.48. We introduce a simple fake-reward\nattack that requires no access to the reward model and significantly increases\nvulnerability, and we propose a lightweight highlighting defense that reduces\nthe fake-reward $\\Delta$ASR from 0.23 to 0.07 without degrading utility.

Existing stall-free batching schedulers proposed by\nSarathi, while effective at preventing decode stalls, introduce significant\ncomputational unfairness.

In this paper, we delve into the challenges caused by\nentropy and propose the Agentic Entropy-Balanced Policy Optimization (AEPO), an\nagentic RL algorithm designed to balance entropy in both the rollout and policy\nupdate phases. AEPO comprises two core components: (1) a dynamic\nentropy-balanced rollout mechanism that adaptively allocate global and branch\nsampling budget through entropy pre-monitoring, while imposing a branch penalty\non consecutive high-entropy tool-call steps to prevent over-branching issues;\nand (2) Entropy-Balanced Policy Optimization that inserts a stop-gradient\noperation into the high-entropy clipping term to preserve and properly rescale\ngradients on high-entropy tokens, while incorporating entropy-aware advantage\nestimation to prioritize learning on high-uncertainty tokens. Results across 14\nchallenging datasets show that AEPO consistently outperforms 7 mainstream RL\nalgorithms.

In contrast, many planners\ninteract better than previously assumed and even improve in multi-lane,\ninteraction-heavy scenarios like lane changes or turns. Methods trained in\nclosed-loop demonstrate the best and most stable driving performance. However,\nwhen reaching their limits in augmented edge-case scenarios, all learned\nplanners degrade abruptly, whereas rule-based planners maintain reasonable\nbasic behavior. Based on our results, we suggest SMART-reactive simulation as a\nnew standard closed-loop benchmark in nuPlan and release the SMART agents as a\ndrop-in alternative to IDM at https://github.com/shgd95/InteractiveClosedLoop."}

On ImageNet 256$^2$, it\nattains a 1-NFE FID of 2.85, outperforming MeanFlow of the same DiT\narchitecture. On FLUX.1-12B and Qwen-Image-20B at 4 NFEs, $\\pi$-Flow achieves\nsubstantially better diversity than state-of-the-art few-step methods, while\nmaintaining teacher-level quality."}

Yet, the scarcity of large-scale paired\ndatasets containing multiple images of the same individual forces most\napproaches to adopt reconstruction-based training. This reliance often leads to\na failure mode we term copy-paste, where the model directly replicates the\nreference face rather than preserving identity across natural variations in\npose, expression, or lighting. Such over-similarity undermines controllability\nand limits the expressive power of generation. To address these limitations, we\n(1) construct a large-scale paired dataset MultiID-2M, tailored for\nmulti-person scenarios, providing diverse references for each identity; (2)\nintroduce a benchmark that quantifies both copy-paste artifacts and the\ntrade-off between identity fidelity and variation; and (3) propose a novel\ntraining paradigm with a contrastive identity loss that leverages paired data\nto balance fidelity with diversity. These contributions culminate in\nWithAnyone, a diffusion-based model that effectively mitigates copy-paste while\npreserving high identity similarity. Extensive qualitative and quantitative\nexperiments demonstrate that WithAnyone significantly reduces copy-paste\nartifacts, improves controllability over pose and expression, and maintains\nstrong perceptual quality.

However, most existing methods still rely on pixel-aligned\nrepresentations as the basis for world evolution, neglecting the inherent 3D\nnature of the physical world. This could undermine the 3D consistency and\ndiminish the modeling efficiency of world models. In this paper, we present\nTerra, a native 3D world model that represents and generates explorable\nenvironments in an intrinsic 3D latent space. Specifically, we propose a novel\npoint-to-Gaussian variational autoencoder (P2G-VAE) that encodes 3D inputs into\na latent point representation, which is subsequently decoded as 3D Gaussian\nprimitives to jointly model geometry and appearance. We then introduce a sparse\npoint flow matching network (SPFlow) for generating the latent point\nrepresentation, which simultaneously denoises the positions and features of the\npoint latents. Our Terra enables exact multi-view consistency with native 3D\nrepresentation and architecture, and supports flexible rendering from any\nviewpoint with only a single generation process. Furthermore, Terra achieves\nexplorable world modeling through progressive generation in the point latent\nspace. We conduct extensive experiments on the challenging indoor scenes from\nScanNet v2. Terra achieves state-of-the-art performance in both reconstruction\nand generation with high 3D consistency."}

Yet, two lingering clouds cast shadows over its widespread\nexploration and promotion: (-) What fundamental constraints set native VLMs\napart from modular ones, and to what extent can these barriers be overcome? (-)\nHow to make research in native VLMs more accessible and democratized, thereby\naccelerating progress in the field. In this paper, we clarify these challenges\nand outline guiding principles for constructing native VLMs. Specifically, one\nnative VLM primitive should: (i) effectively align pixel and word\nrepresentations within a shared semantic space; (ii) seamlessly integrate the\nstrengths of formerly separate vision and language modules; (iii) inherently\nembody various cross-modal properties that support unified vision-language\nencoding, aligning, and reasoning. Hence, we launch NEO, a novel family of\nnative VLMs built from first principles, capable of rivaling top-tier modular\ncounterparts across diverse real-world scenarios. With only 390M image-text\nexamples, NEO efficiently develops visual perception from scratch while\nmitigating vision-language conflicts inside a dense and monolithic model\ncrafted from our elaborate primitives. We position NEO as a cornerstone for\nscalable and powerful native VLMs, paired with a rich set of reusable\ncomponents that foster a cost-effective and extensible ecosystem.

These\nmodels can independently produce high-quality edits for each image in a set of\nmulti-view images of a 3D scene or object, but they do not maintain consistency\nacross views. Existing approaches typically address this by optimizing over\nexplicit 3D representations, but they suffer from a lengthy optimization\nprocess and instability under sparse view settings. We propose an implicit 3D\nregularization approach by constraining the generated 2D image sequences to\nadhere to a pre-trained multi-view image distribution. This is achieved through\ncoupled diffusion sampling, a simple diffusion sampling technique that\nconcurrently samples two trajectories from both a multi-view image distribution\nand a 2D edited image distribution, using a coupling term to enforce the\nmulti-view consistency among the generated images. We validate the\neffectiveness and generality of this framework on three distinct multi-view\nimage editing tasks, demonstrating its applicability across various model\narchitectures and highlighting its potential as a general solution for\nmulti-view consistent editing."}
