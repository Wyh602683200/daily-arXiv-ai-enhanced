While this approach is well established in tabular settings,\nextending it to deep reinforcement learning (DRL) poses challenges due to the\ncontinuous nature of the state-action space, the noisy approximations of neural\nnetworks, and the impracticality of storing all past models for reuse. In this\nwork, we address these challenges and introduce DQInit, a method that adapts\nvalue function initialization to DRL. DQInit reuses compact tabular Q-values\nextracted from previously solved tasks as a transferable knowledge base. It\nemploys a knownness-based mechanism to softly integrate these transferred\nvalues into underexplored regions and gradually shift toward the agent's\nlearned estimates, avoiding the limitations of fixed time decay. Our approach\noffers a novel perspective on knowledge transfer in DRL by relying solely on\nvalue estimates rather than policies or demonstrations, effectively combining\nthe strengths of jumpstart RL and policy distillation while mitigating their\ndrawbacks. Experiments across multiple continuous control tasks demonstrate\nthat DQInit consistently improves early learning efficiency, stability, and\noverall performance compared to standard initialization and existing transfer\ntechniques."}

Addressing this gap, I introduce\nthe Othello AI Arena, a novel benchmark framework designed to evaluate\nintelligent systems based on their capacity for limited-time adaptation to\nunseen environments.

With this,\nevaluation of the meta-level intelligence can be separated from the task-level\nstrategy performance. The Arena features a diverse set of game stages,\nincluding public stages for development and private stages with structural and\nrule variations designed to test genuine adaptive and generalization\ncapabilities. Implemented as an accessible web-based platform, the Arena\nprovides real-time visualization, automated evaluation using multi-dimensional\nmetrics, and comprehensive logging for post-hoc analysis.

To address the long computation times of zero-shot trainings,\nwe used a training approach that leverages a pretrained network to reduce\nbackpropagation depth during training. Results: Zero-shot learning\nreconstruction significantly improved visual image quality compared to\ncompressed sensing reconstruction, particularly in terms of signal-to-noise\nratio and ductal delineation, and reached a level of quality comparable to that\nof successful respiratory-triggered acquisitions with regular breathing\npatterns. Shallow training provided nearly equivalent reconstruction\nperformance with a training time of 11 minutes in comparison to 271 minutes for\na conventional zero-shot training. Conclusion: Zero-shot learning delivers\nhigh-fidelity MRCP reconstructions with reduced breath-hold times, and shallow\ntraining offers a practical solution for translation to time-constrained\nclinical workflows."}

However, deep FER models often struggle with subtle\nexpressions and high inter-subject variability, limiting their performance in\nreal-world applications. To improve their performance, source-free domain\nadaptation (SFDA) methods have been proposed to personalize a pretrained source\nmodel using only unlabeled target domain data, thereby avoiding data privacy,\nstorage, and transmission constraints. This paper addresses a challenging\nscenario where source data is unavailable for adaptation, and only unlabeled\ntarget data consisting solely of neutral expressions is available. SFDA methods\nare not typically designed to adapt using target data from only a single class.\nFurther, using models to generate facial images with non-neutral expressions\ncan be unstable and computationally intensive. In this paper, personalized\nfeature translation (PFT) is proposed for SFDA. Unlike current image\ntranslation methods for SFDA, our lightweight method operates in the latent\nspace. We first pre-train the translator on the source domain data to transform\nthe subject-specific style features from one source subject into another.\nExpression information is preserved by optimizing a combination of expression\nconsistency and style-aware objectives.

On MNIST (60k train, 10k test) and Fashion-MNIST (60k\ntrain, 10k test), our method reaches 97.8% and 89.3% test accuracy on the\nofficial 10k test sets, respectively, in 3.9s--4.5s using approximately 130k\ntrainable parameters and only 250 epochs on an RTX 5060 (16GB). We provide a\nmulti-layer extension (optimised activations at each hidden stage), learnable\nridge parameters, optional PCA/PLS projections, and theory linking the\ncondition number of prototype matrices to generalisation. The approach yields\nfavourable accuracy--speed--size trade-offs against ELM, random-feature ridge,\nand shallow MLPs trained by back-propagation."}

Furthermore, a\nconstraint for temporal classification consistency (TCC) aligns the lesion\nclassification output with the evolution of the physiological signal, further\nenhancing diagnostic reliability. Extensive experiments on two independent\nliver MRI datasets demonstrate that T-CACE outperforms state-of-the-art methods\nin image synthesis, segmentation, and lesion classification. This framework\noffers a clinically relevant and efficient alternative to traditional\ncontrast-enhanced imaging, improving safety, diagnostic efficiency, and\nreliability for the assessment of liver lesion. The implementation of T-CACE is\npublicly available at: https://github.com/xiaojiao929/T-CACE."}

The field has developed diverse alignment\napproaches including traditional fine-tuning methods (RLHF, instruction\ntuning), post-hoc correction systems, and inference-time interventions, each\nwith distinct advantages and limitations. However, the lack of unified\nevaluation frameworks makes it difficult to systematically compare these\nparadigms and guide deployment decisions. This paper introduces a\nmulti-dimensional evaluation of alignment techniques for LLMs, a comprehensive\nevaluation framework that provides a systematic comparison across all major\nalignment paradigms. Our framework assesses methods along four key dimensions:\nalignment detection, alignment quality, computational efficiency, and\nrobustness. Through experiments across diverse base models and alignment\nstrategies, we demonstrate the utility of our framework in identifying\nstrengths and limitations of current state-of-the-art models, providing\nvaluable insights for future research directions."}

First, we introduce Marginal Gain Advantage Estimation, which\nrefines the reward advantage function by using a sliding window baseline\ncomputed from historical episodic returns, thus aligning the advantage\nestimation with the agent's evolving recognition of action value in\nnon-Markovian settings. Second, we develop a Semantic Dynamics Model based on\npatchified water semantic masks that provides more interpretable and\ndata-efficient short-term prediction of future observations compared to latent\nvision dynamics models. Third, we present the Constrained Actor Dynamics\nEstimator architecture, which integrates the actor, the cost estimator, and SDM\nfor cost advantage estimation to form a model-based SafeRL framework capable of\nsolving partially observable Constrained Submodular Markov Decision Processes.\nSimulation results demonstrate that MGAE achieves faster convergence and\nsuperior performance over traditional critic-based methods like Generalized\nAdvantage Estimation.

However, a key question\nremains: given that real-world image datasets already constitute a natural\nsource of high-quality data, why should we use GPT-4o-generated synthetic data?\nIn this work, we identify two key advantages of synthetic images. First, they\ncan complement rare scenarios in real-world datasets, such as surreal fantasy\nor multi-reference image generation, which frequently occur in user queries.\nSecond, they provide clean and controllable supervision. Real-world data often\ncontains complex background noise and inherent misalignment between text\ndescriptions and image content, whereas synthetic images offer pure backgrounds\nand long-tailed supervision signals, facilitating more accurate text-to-image\nalignment. Building on these insights, we introduce Echo-4o-Image, a 180K-scale\nsynthetic dataset generated by GPT-4o, harnessing the power of synthetic image\ndata to address blind spots in real-world coverage. Using this dataset, we\nfine-tune the unified multimodal generation baseline Bagel to obtain Echo-4o.\nIn addition, we propose two new evaluation benchmarks for a more accurate and\nchallenging assessment of image generation capabilities: GenEval++, which\nincreases instruction complexity to mitigate score saturation, and\nImagine-Bench, which focuses on evaluating both the understanding and\ngeneration of imaginative content. Echo-4o demonstrates strong performance\nacross standard benchmarks.
