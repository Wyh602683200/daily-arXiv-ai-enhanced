Two common end-user programming paradigms include\ndrag-and-drop interfaces and natural language programming.

The main contributions of this study include: (1)\na comprehensive architecture combining an urban mobility foundation model with\nagent cognitive systems and transport simulation environment, (2) a fully\nfunctional prototype implementation, and (3) systematic validation\ndemonstrating that generative agents produce believable travel behaviors.\nThrough designed reflection processes, generative agents in this study can\ntransform specific travel experiences into generalized insights, enabling\nrealistic behavioral adaptation over time with specialized mechanisms for\nactivity planning and real-time reactive behaviors tailored to urban mobility\ncontexts. Experiments show that generative agents perform competitively with\nhuman annotators in mobility scenarios while naturally producing macroscopic\ntraffic evolution patterns.

Recently, with the development of Diffusion-based Dense Prediction\n(DDP) models, the exploration of DA designs tailored to this framework is worth\nexploring, since the diffusion model is effective in modeling the distribution\ntransformation that comprises domain information. In this work, we propose a\ntraining-free mechanism for DDP frameworks, endowing them with DA capabilities.\nOur motivation arises from the observation that the exposure bias (e.g., noise\nstatistics bias) in diffusion brings domain shift, and different domains in\nconditions of DDP models can also be effectively captured by the noise\nprediction statistics. Based on this, we propose a training-free Domain Noise\nAlignment (DNA) approach, which alleviates the variations of noise statistics\nto domain changes during the diffusion sampling process, thereby achieving\ndomain adaptation. Specifically, when the source domain is available, we\ndirectly adopt the DNA method to achieve domain adaptation by aligning the\nnoise statistics of the target domain with those of the source domain.

Considering graph data, especially graphs without textual features, is\nubiquitous in real-world applications such as social networks and\nrecommendation systems, some researchers have attempted to extend this paradigm\nto the graph field, aiming to construct graph foundation models. However,\nunlike CV and NLP, there are huge gaps among the semantics and properties of\ngraphs in different domains, while current works still adopt traditional\ncontrastive pre-training strategies designed in the single-domain scenario,\nwhich regard contrastive samples from different domains as equivalent. From\nexperimental investigations, we discovered that inherent domain-specific\ndifferences prevent these strategies from effectively absorbing knowledge from\ndifferent domains to generate informative representations.

The\ninvestigation commences with replicating findings from a previous baseline\nstudy, thereby underscoring its susceptibility to variations in the underlying\ngeneration model. Subsequently, we propose an innovative watermarking approach\nand subject it to rigorous evaluation, employing paraphrased generated text to\nasses its robustness.

Efforts to improve and strengthen evaluations of\nculture are central to the project of cultural alignment in large AI systems.\nThis position paper argues that machine learning (ML) and human-computer\ninteraction (HCI) approaches to evaluation are limited. I propose two key\nshifts. First, instead of asking \"what is culture?\" at the start of system\nevaluations, I propose beginning with the question: \"when is culture?\" Second,\nwhile I acknowledge the philosophical claim that cultural universals exist, the\nchallenge is not simply to describe them, but to situate them in relation to\ntheir particulars. Taken together, these conceptual shifts invite evaluation\napproaches that move beyond technical requirements, toward perspectives more\nresponsive to the complexities of culture."}

We introduce the Barycentric Weight Layer (BWLer), which models\nthe PDE solution through barycentric polynomial interpolation. A BWLer can be\nadded on top of an existing MLP (a BWLer-hat) or replace it completely\n(explicit BWLer), cleanly separating how we represent the solution from how we\ntake derivatives for the PDE loss. Using BWLer, we identify fundamental\nprecision limitations within the MLP: on a simple 1-D interpolation task, even\nMLPs with O(1e5) parameters stall around 1e-8 RMSE -- about eight orders above\nfloat64 machine precision -- before any PDE terms are added. In PDE learning,\nadding a BWLer lifts this ceiling and exposes a tradeoff between achievable\naccuracy and the conditioning of the PDE loss. For linear PDEs we fully\ncharacterize this tradeoff with an explicit error decomposition and navigate it\nduring training with spectral derivatives and preconditioning. Across five\nbenchmark PDEs, adding a BWLer on top of an MLP improves RMSE by up to 30x for\nconvection, 10x for reaction, and 1800x for wave equations while remaining\ncompatible with first-order optimizers.

PAC Bench features a diverse dataset with over 30,000 annotations,\ncomprising 673 real-world images (115 object classes, 15 property types, and 1\nto 3 affordances defined per class), 100 real-world humanoid-view scenarios,\nand 120 unique simulated constraint scenarios across four tasks.\n  Our evaluations reveal significant gaps in the ability of current VLMs to\ngrasp fundamental physical concepts, highlighting limitations in their\nsuitability for reliable robot manipulation and pointing to key areas for\ntargeted research.

While\nproprioception is intuitively important for decision-making and obstacle\navoidance, simply incorporating all proprioceptive states leads to a surprising\ndegradation in imitation learning performance. In this work, we identify the\nunderlying issue as the proprioception shift problem, where the distributions\nof proprioceptive states diverge significantly between training and deployment.\nTo address this challenge, we propose a domain adaptation framework that\nbridges the gap by utilizing rollout data collected during deployment.
