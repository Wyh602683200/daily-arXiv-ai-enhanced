However, extending these\ngains to domains without clear-cut success criteria (e.g.,computer use) remains\na challenge: while humans can recognize suitable outcomes, translating this\nintuition into scalable rules is non-trivial. Multimodal Large Language\nModels(MLLMs) emerge as a promising solution, given their world knowledge,\nhuman-preference alignment, and reasoning skills. We evaluate MLLMs as\nverifiers of agent trajectories across web navigation, computer use, and\nrobotic manipulation, and identify a critical limitation: agreement bias, a\nstrong tendency for MLLMs to favor information in their context window, often\ngenerating chains of thought to rationalize flawed behavior. This bias is\npervasive across models, resilient to test-time scaling, and can impact several\nmethods using MLLMs as evaluators (e.g.,data filtering). Notably, it occurs\ndespite MLLMs showing strong, human-aligned priors on desired behavior. To\naddress this, we propose Self-Grounded Verification (SGV), a lightweight method\nthat enables more effective use of MLLMs' knowledge and reasoning by harnessing\ntheir own sampling mechanisms via unconditional and conditional generation. SGV\noperates in two steps: first, the MLLM is elicited to retrieve broad priors\nabout task completion, independent of the data under evaluation. Then,\nconditioned on self-generated priors, it reasons over and evaluates a candidate\ntrajectory. Enhanced with SGV, MLLM verifiers show gains of up to 20 points in\naccuracy and failure detection rates, and can perform real-time supervision of\nheterogeneous agents, boosting task completion of a GUI specialist in OSWorld,\na diffusion policy in robomimic, and a ReAct agent in VisualWebArena -- setting\na new state of the art on the benchmark, surpassing the previous best by 48%."}

It is increasingly integrated into advanced therapeutic\nworkflows, such as hybrid Positron Emission Tomography/Magnetic Resonance\n(PET/MR) imaging and MR-only radiation therapy. These integrated approaches are\ncritically dependent on accurate estimation of radiation attenuation, which is\ntypically facilitated by synthesizing Computed Tomography (CT) images from MR\nscans to generate attenuation maps. However, existing MR-to-CT synthesis\nmethods for whole-body imaging often suffer from poor spatial alignment between\nthe generated CT and input MR images, and insufficient image quality for\nreliable use in downstream clinical tasks. In this paper, we present a novel 3D\nWavelet Latent Diffusion Model (3D-WLDM) that addresses these limitations by\nperforming modality translation in a learned latent space. By incorporating a\nWavelet Residual Module into the encoder-decoder architecture, we enhance the\ncapture and reconstruction of fine-scale features across image and latent\nspaces. To preserve anatomical integrity during the diffusion process, we\ndisentangle structural and modality-specific characteristics and anchor the\nstructural component to prevent warping. We also introduce a Dual Skip\nConnection Attention mechanism within the diffusion model, enabling the\ngeneration of high-resolution CT images with improved representation of bony\nstructures and soft-tissue contrast."}

While recent efforts have explored adapting large language\nmodels (LLMs) for time-series forecasting, LLMs primarily capture\none-dimensional sequential dependencies and struggle to model the richer\nspatio-temporal (ST) correlations essential for accurate ST forecasting. In\nthis paper, we present \\textbf{ST-VFM}, a novel framework that systematically\nreprograms Vision Foundation Models (VFMs) for general-purpose spatio-temporal\nforecasting. While VFMs offer powerful spatial priors, two key challenges arise\nwhen applying them to ST tasks: (1) the lack of inherent temporal modeling\ncapacity and (2) the modality gap between visual and ST data. To address these,\nST-VFM adopts a \\emph{dual-branch architecture} that integrates raw ST inputs\nwith auxiliary ST flow inputs, where the flow encodes lightweight temporal\ndifference signals interpretable as dynamic spatial cues. To effectively\nprocess these dual-branch inputs, ST-VFM introduces two dedicated reprogramming\nstages. The \\emph{pre-VFM reprogramming} stage applies a Temporal-Aware Token\nAdapter to embed temporal context and align both branches into VFM-compatible\nfeature spaces. The \\emph{post-VFM reprogramming} stage introduces a Bilateral\nCross-Prompt Coordination module, enabling dynamic interaction between branches\nthrough prompt-based conditioning, thus enriching joint representation learning\nwithout modifying the frozen VFM backbone. Extensive experiments on ten\nspatio-temporal datasets show that ST-VFM outperforms state-of-the-art\nbaselines, demonstrating effectiveness and robustness across VFM backbones\n(e.g., DINO, CLIP, DEIT) and ablation studies, establishing it as a strong\ngeneral framework for spatio-temporal forecasting."}

In this study, we provide a\ncomprehensive evaluation of foundation model-based registration algorithms for\nbreast MRI. We assess five pre-trained encoders, including DINO-v2, SAM,\nMedSAM, SSLSAM, and MedCLIP, across four key breast registration tasks that\ncapture variations in different years and dates, sequences, modalities, and\npatient disease status (lesion versus no lesion).

Learning such a mapping is challenging\nfor many reasons, but largely because MOS exhibits high levels of inherent\nvariance due to perceptual and experimental-design differences. Many solutions\nhave been proposed, but many approaches do not properly incorporate perceptual\nfactors into their learning algorithms (beyond the MOS label), which could lead\nto unsatisfactory results. To this end, we propose JSQA, a two-stage framework\nthat pretrains an audio encoder using perceptually-guided contrastive learning\non just noticeable difference (JND) pairs, followed by fine-tuning for MOS\nprediction. We first generate pairs of audio data within JND levels, which are\nthen used to pretrain an encoder to leverage perceptual quality similarity\ninformation and map it into an embedding space. The JND pairs come from clean\nLibriSpeech utterances that are mixed with background noise from CHiME-3, at\ndifferent signal-to-noise ratios (SNRs). The encoder is later fine-tuned with\naudio samples from the NISQA dataset for MOS prediction. Experimental results\nsuggest that perceptually-inspired contrastive pretraining significantly\nimproves the model performance evaluated by various metrics when compared\nagainst the same network trained from scratch without pretraining.

A systematic and comprehensive review of\nfirst-generation EEG-FMs is therefore necessary to understand the current\nstate-of-the-art and identify key directions for future EEG-FMs. To that end,\nthis study reviews 10 early EEG-FMs and presents a critical synthesis of their\nmethodology, empirical findings, and outstanding research gaps. We find that\nmost EEG-FMs adopt a sequence-based modeling scheme that relies on\ntransformer-based backbones and the reconstruction of masked sequences for\nself-supervision. However, model evaluations remain heterogeneous and largely\nlimited, making it challenging to assess their practical off-the-shelf utility.\nIn addition to adopting standardized and realistic evaluations, future work\nshould demonstrate more substantial scaling effects and make principled and\ntrustworthy choices throughout the EEG representation learning pipeline. We\nbelieve that developing benchmarks, software tools, technical methodologies,\nand applications in collaboration with domain experts may further advance the\ntranslational utility and real-world adoption of EEG-FMs."}

We propose\na novel, circuit-theory-inspired strategy called Frequency-Dynamic Attention\nModulation (FDAM), which can be easily plugged into ViTs. FDAM directly\nmodulates the overall frequency response of ViTs and consists of two\ntechniques: Attention Inversion (AttInv) and Frequency Dynamic Scaling\n(FreqScale).

First is the Fractal\nConvolution methodology, a segmentation method based on image processing that\nsuccessfully reveals subtle architectural patterns within these irreplaceable\ncultural buildings. The second is a revolutionary Self-Sensitive Tile Filling\n(SSTF) method created especially for West Bengal's mesmerising Bankura\nTerracotta Temples with a brand-new data augmentation method called MosaicSlice\non the third. Furthermore, we delve deeper into the Super Resolution strategy\nto upscale the images without losing significant amount of quality. Our methods\nallow for the development of seamless region-filling and highly detailed tiles\nwhile maintaining authenticity using a novel data augmentation strategy within\naffordable costs introducing automation. By providing effective solutions that\npreserve the delicate balance between tradition and innovation, this study\nimproves the subject and eventually ensures unrivalled efficiency and aesthetic\nexcellence in cultural heritage protection.
