Despite this advancement,\ncurrent AI tutoring systems face limitations associated with their reactive\nnature, often providing direct answers without encouraging deep reflection or\nincorporating structured pedagogical tools and strategies. This limitation is\nmost apparent in the field of mathematics, in which AI tutoring systems remain\nunderdeveloped. This research addresses the question: How can AI tutoring\nsystems move beyond providing reactive assistance to enable structured,\nindividualized, and tool-assisted learning experiences? We introduce a novel\nmulti-agent AI tutoring platform that combines adaptive and personalized\nfeedback, structured course generation, and textbook knowledge retrieval to\nenable modular, tool-assisted learning processes. This system allows students\nto learn new topics while identifying and targeting their weaknesses, revise\nfor exams effectively, and practice on an unlimited number of personalized\nexercises. This article contributes to the field of artificial intelligence in\neducation by introducing a novel platform that brings together pedagogical\nagents and AI-driven components, augmenting the field with modular and\neffective systems for teaching mathematics."}

Making these decisions reliant on human\njudgement is both counter-productive to the aim of exploring very large number\nof scenarios in a timely manner and infeasible when considering the workload\nneeded to involve humans in each of these choices. In this paper, we move human\njudgement outside the simulation decision cycle. Basically, the human will\ndesign the ethical metric space, leaving it to the simulated environment to\nexplore the space. When the simulation completes its testing cycles, the\ntesting environment will come back to the human commander with a few options to\nselect from. The human commander will then exercise human-judgement to select\nthe most appropriate course of action, which will then get executed\naccordingly. We assume that the problem of designing metrics that are\nsufficiently granular to assess the ethical implications of decisions is\nsolved.

To address this question, we take an evaluation-centric perspective\nand identify two critical shortcomings in existing protocols. First,\n\\emph{benchmark contamination} arises from the public availability of test\nproblems, increasing the risk of data leakage. Second, \\emph{evaluation\nfragility} stems from the reliance on single-instance assessments, which are\nhighly sensitive to stochastic outputs and fail to capture reasoning\nconsistency. To overcome these limitations, we introduce {VAR-MATH}, a symbolic\nevaluation framework designed to probe genuine reasoning ability. By converting\nfixed numerical problems into symbolic templates and requiring models to solve\nmultiple instantiations of each, VAR-MATH enforces consistent reasoning across\nstructurally equivalent variants, thereby mitigating contamination and\nimproving evaluation robustness. We apply VAR-MATH to transform two popular\nbenchmarks, AMC23 and AIME24, into their symbolic counterparts, VAR-AMC23 and\nVAR-AIME24.

However, this method has certain limitations, being the most\nconcerning, the poor correlation with the humans. An alternative approach, is\nto have humans evaluate the LLMs. This poses scalability issues as there is a\nlarge and growing number of models to evaluate making it impractical (and\ncostly) to run traditional studies based on recruiting a number of evaluators\nand having them rank the responses of the models. An alternative approach is\nthe use of public arenas, such as the popular LM arena, on which any user can\nfreely evaluate models on any question and rank the responses of two models.\nThe results are then elaborated into a model ranking. An increasingly important\naspect of LLMs is their energy consumption and, therefore, evaluating how\nenergy awareness influences the decisions of humans in selecting a model is of\ninterest.

Second, it is\ngenerated from the highly expressive framework of Monadic Second-Order (MSO)\nlogic on graphs, paving the way toward automatic problem generation at scale;\nideal for building RL environments. Third, many of our problems are intimately\nrelated to the frontier of theoretical computer science, and to central\nconjectures therein, such as the Strong Exponential Time Hypothesis (SETH). As\nsuch, any significant algorithmic progress on our dataset, beyond known\nresults, could carry profound theoretical implications.\n  Remarkably, state-of-the-art models like OpenAI's o3 fail entirely on\nFormulaOne, solving less than 1% of the questions, even when given 10 attempts\nand explanatory fewshot examples -- highlighting how far they remain from\nexpert-level understanding in some domains.

These methods often involve\nmathematical refinements that may not correspond to how people actually\nperceive or process numerical information. This paper explores an alternative\napproach based on a modified operation of addition defined over coarse\npartitions of the outcome space. In this model, exact numerical values are\ngrouped into perceptual categories, and each value is replaced by a\nrepresentative element of its group before being added. This method allows for\na phenomenon where repeated additions eventually cease to affect the outcome, a\nbehavior described as inertial stabilization.

However, recent studies have called into question the\nability of LMs to categorize sentences according to modality (Michaelov et al.,\n2025; Kauf et al., 2023).

Unlike traditional EQA settings, which typically\nfocus either on understanding the present environment alone or on recalling a\nsingle past observation, LA-EQA challenges an agent to reason over past,\npresent, and possible future states, deciding when to explore, when to consult\nits memory, and when to stop gathering observations and provide a final answer.\nStandard EQA approaches based on large models struggle in this setting due to\nlimited context windows, absence of persistent memory, and an inability to\ncombine memory recall with active exploration.

The proposed\nmethod adopts a pre-trained decoder to transform raw EEG signals into\nprobabilistic reward components, en abling effective policy learning even in\nthe presence of sparse external rewards. We evaluate our approach in a\nsimulation environment built on the MuJoCo physics engine, using a Kinova Gen2\nrobotic arm to perform a complex pick-and-place task that requires avoiding\nobstacles while manipulating target objects. The results show that agents\ntrained with decoded EEG feedback achieve performance comparable to those\ntrained with dense, manually designed rewards. These findings validate the\npotential of using implicit neural feedback for scalable and human-aligned\nreinforcement learning in interactive robotics."}

Traditional\nflow matching and diffusion policies sample from standard source distributions\n(e.g., Gaussian noise) and require additional conditioning mechanisms like\ncross-attention to condition action generation on visual information, creating\ntime and space overheads. VITA proposes a novel paradigm that treats latent\nimages as the flow source, learning an inherent mapping from vision to action\nwhile eliminating separate conditioning modules and preserving generative\nmodeling capabilities. Learning flows between fundamentally different\nmodalities like vision and action is challenging due to sparse action data\nlacking semantic structures and dimensional mismatches between high-dimensional\nvisual representations and raw actions. We address this by creating a\nstructured action latent space via an autoencoder as the flow matching target,\nup-sampling raw actions to match visual representation shapes. Crucially, we\nsupervise flow matching with both encoder targets and final action outputs\nthrough flow latent decoding, which backpropagates action reconstruction loss\nthrough sequential flow matching ODE solving steps for effective end-to-end\nlearning. Implemented as simple MLP layers, VITA is evaluated on challenging\nbi-manual manipulation tasks on the ALOHA platform, including 5 simulation and\n2 real-world tasks.

However, we observe that most real-world\nscenarios do not require such an extensive number of visual tokens. While the\nperformance drops significantly in a small subset of OCR-related tasks, models\nstill perform accurately in most other general VQA tasks with only 1/4\nresolution. Therefore, we propose to dynamically process distinct samples with\ndifferent resolutions, and present a new paradigm for visual token compression,\nnamely, VisionThink. It starts with a downsampled image and smartly decides\nwhether it is sufficient for problem solving. Otherwise, the model could output\na special token to request the higher-resolution image. Compared to existing\nEfficient VLM methods that compress tokens using fixed pruning ratios or\nthresholds, VisionThink autonomously decides whether to compress tokens case by\ncase. As a result, it demonstrates strong fine-grained visual understanding\ncapability on OCR-related tasks, and meanwhile saves substantial visual tokens\non simpler tasks. We adopt reinforcement learning and propose the LLM-as-Judge\nstrategy to successfully apply RL to general VQA tasks. Moreover, we carefully\ndesign a reward function and penalty mechanism to achieve a stable and\nreasonable image resize call ratio. Extensive experiments demonstrate the\nsuperiority, efficiency, and effectiveness of our method. Our code is available\nat https://github.com/dvlab-research/VisionThink."}

Current methods, such as reducing inter-frame redundancy,\nemploying separate models for image-text relevance assessment, or utilizing\ntemporal video grounding for event localization, substantially adopt\nunsupervised learning paradigms, whereas they struggle to address the complex\nscenarios in long video understanding. We propose Instructed Temporal Grounding\nfor Videos (VideoITG), featuring customized frame sampling aligned with user\ninstructions. The core of VideoITG is the VidThinker pipeline, an automated\nannotation framework that explicitly mimics the human annotation process.\nFirst, it generates detailed clip-level captions conditioned on the\ninstruction; then, it retrieves relevant video segments through\ninstruction-guided reasoning; finally, it performs fine-grained frame selection\nto pinpoint the most informative visual evidence. Leveraging VidThinker, we\nconstruct the VideoITG-40K dataset, containing 40K videos and 500K instructed\ntemporal grounding annotations. We then design a plug-and-play VideoITG model,\nwhich takes advantage of visual language alignment and reasoning capabilities\nof Video-LLMs, for effective frame selection in a discriminative manner.\nCoupled with Video-LLMs, VideoITG achieves consistent performance improvements\nacross multiple multimodal video understanding benchmarks, showing its\nsuperiority and great potentials for video understanding."}
