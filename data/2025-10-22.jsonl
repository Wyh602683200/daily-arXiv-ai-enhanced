Existing transfer methods attempt to bridge this gap by aligning the\nstatic weight spaces of models, a brittle and indirect approach that relies on\ntenuous correlations between parameter geometries. This paper introduces a\nfundamentally different and more direct paradigm: the Cartridge Activation\nSpace Transfer (CAST), a novel framework that liberates LoRA-encoded behaviors\nby learning a direct, nonlinear mapping between the activation manifolds, the\ngeometric structures formed by the model's internal neuron activations, of two\ndistinct LLM architectures. CAST treats a pre-trained LoRA as a frozen\n\"behavioral kernel.\" It learns a set of lightweight, bidirectional projection\nheads that translate the target model's activation stream into the source\nmodel's latent space, apply the frozen kernel, and project the result back.\nThis process, trained on a general text corpus without any task-specific data,\neffectively decouples the learned skill from the source architecture. We\ndemonstrate that CAST enables true \"zero-shot\" translation of any standard LoRA\nadapter. Our experiments, including transfers between heterogeneous model\nfamilies like Llama-2 and Mistral, show that CAST-translated adapters achieve\n85-95\\% of the performance of a LoRA fully retrained on the target model,\nquantitatively outperforming current weight-space transfer techniques and\nestablishing a new state-of-the-art in model interoperability."}

While the majority of related work on\nmemorisation has focused on measuring success of training data extraction\nthrough string matching, we argue that embedding models are better suited for\nour specific goals. Distances measured through a high quality embedding model\ncan identify semantic similarities between strings that a different metric such\nas edit distance will struggle to capture. In fact, in our investigation,\napproximate string matching would have severely undercounted (by a conservative\nestimate of $10\\times$) the amount of data that can be extracted due to trivial\nartifacts that deflate the metric. Interestingly, we find that models readily\nregurgitate training data that was used in post-training phases such as SFT or\nRL.

Within the simulation, an\nautonomous robot predicted the shooter's movements and positioned itself\nstrategically to interfere and distract. The strategy the robot used to\napproach the shooter was manipulated -- either moving directly in front of the\nshooter (aggressive) or maintaining distance (passive) -- and the distraction\nmethod, ranging from no additional cues (low), to siren and lights (medium), to\nsiren, lights, and smoke to impair visibility (high). An aggressive,\nhigh-distraction robot reduced the number of victims by 46.6% relative to a\nno-robot control.

While IL has\nbeen widely applied to single-robot settings, relatively few studies have\naddressed the extension of these methods to multi-agent systems, especially in\nsettings where a single human must provide demonstrations to a team of\ncollaborating robots. In this paper, we introduce and study Round-Robin\nBehavior Cloning (R2BC), a method that enables a single human operator to\neffectively train multi-robot systems through sequential, single-agent\ndemonstrations. Our approach allows the human to teleoperate one agent at a\ntime and incrementally teach multi-agent behavior to the entire system, without\nrequiring demonstrations in the joint multi-agent action space. We show that\nR2BC methods match, and in some cases surpass, the performance of an oracle\nbehavior cloning approach trained on privileged synchronized demonstrations\nacross four multi-agent simulated tasks. Finally, we deploy R2BC on two\nphysical robot tasks trained using real human demonstrations."}

Our dataset features real-world\ninteraction data from 57K users, who collectively have built 242K customized\nLoRAs, written 3M text prompts, and created 5M generated images. With user\npreference annotations from our dataset, we were able to train better\npreference alignment models. In addition, leveraging individual user\npreference, we investigated the performance of retrieval models and a\nvision-language model on personalized image retrieval and generative model\nrecommendation. Finally, we propose an end-to-end framework for editing\ncustomized diffusion models in a latent weight space to align with individual\nuser preferences. Our results demonstrate that the ImageGem dataset enables,\nfor the first time, a new paradigm for generative model personalization."}

A few recent works (Zhu et al., 2023, Mukherjee et al., 2024,\nThekumparampil et al., 2024) have explored using multiple comparisons and\nranking feedback, but their performance guarantees fail to improve-and can even\ndeteriorate-as the feedback length increases, despite the richer information\navailable. To address this gap, we adopt the Plackett-Luce (PL) model for\nranking feedback over action subsets and propose M-AUPO, an algorithm that\nselects multiple actions by maximizing the average uncertainty within the\noffered subset. We prove that M-AUPO achieves a suboptimality gap of\n$\\tilde{\\mathcal{O}}\\left( \\frac{d}{T} \\sqrt{ \\sum_{t=1}^T \\frac{1}{|S_t|}}\n\\right)$, where $T$ is the total number of rounds, $d$ is the feature\ndimension, and $|S_t|$ is the size of the subset at round $t$.

Much current work has been focusing\non designing the test sample generators, ignoring the valuable knowledge about\ndata characteristics that can help guide the perturbation and hence limiting\ntheir full potential. In this paper, we seek to bridge such a gap by proposing\na generic framework of causally perturbed fairness testing, dubbed CausalFT.\nThrough causal inference, the key idea of CausalFT is to extract the most\ndirectly and causally relevant non-sensitive feature to its sensitive\ncounterpart, which can jointly influence the prediction of the label. Such a\ncausal relationship is then seamlessly injected into the perturbation to guide\na test sample generator. Unlike existing generator-level work, CausalFT serves\nas a higher-level framework that can be paired with diverse base generators.\nExtensive experiments on 1296 cases confirm that CausalFT can considerably\nimprove arbitrary base generators in revealing fairness bugs over 93% of the\ncases with acceptable extra runtime overhead.

We then\ngo beyond frequency-based prediction to examine the dynamic usage of layer\ndepth across three case studies. (i) Part-of-speech analysis shows that\nfunction words are, on average, the earliest to be predicted correctly. (ii)\nFact recall task analysis shows that, in a multi-token answer, the first token\nrequires more computational depth than the rest. (iii) Multiple-choice task\nanalysis shows that the model identifies the format of the response within the\nfirst half of the layers, but finalizes its response only toward the end.\nTogether, our results provide a detailed view of depth usage in LLMs, shedding\nlight on the layer-by-layer computations that underlie successful predictions\nand providing insights for future works to improve computational efficiency in\ntransformer-based models."}

Region-level MLLMs have been a promising step. However,\nprevious attempts are generally optimized to understand given regions in\nisolation, neglecting crucial global contexts. To address this, we introduce\nGrasp Any Region (GAR) for comprehen- sive region-level visual understanding.\nEmpowered by an effective RoI-aligned feature replay technique, GAR supports\n(1) precise perception by leveraging necessary global contexts, and (2)\nmodeling interactions between multiple prompts. Together, it then naturally\nachieves (3) advanced compositional reasoning to answer specific free-form\nquestions about any region, shifting the paradigm from passive description to\nactive dialogue. Moreover, we construct GAR-Bench, which not only provides a\nmore accurate evaluation of single-region comprehension, but also, more\nimportantly, measures interactions and complex reasoning across multiple\nregions. Extensive experiments have demonstrated that GAR-1B not only maintains\nthe state-of-the-art captioning capabilities, e.g., outperforming DAM-3B +4.5\non DLC-Bench, but also excels at modeling relationships between multiple\nprompts with advanced comprehension capabilities, even surpassing InternVL3-78B\non GAR-Bench-VQA. More importantly, our zero-shot GAR-8B even outperforms\nin-domain VideoRefer-7B on VideoRefer-BenchQ, indicating its strong\ncapabilities can be easily transferred to videos."}
