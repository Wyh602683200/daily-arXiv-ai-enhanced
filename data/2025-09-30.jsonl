Although numerous efforts have been\nmade to quantify and mitigate social bias in AI models, geographic bias (in\nshort, geo-bias) receives much less attention, which presents unique\nchallenges. While previous work has explored ways to quantify geo-bias, these\nmeasures are model-specific (e.g., mean absolute deviation of LLM ratings) or\nspatially implicit (e.g., average fairness scores of all spatial partitions).\nWe lack a model-agnostic, universally applicable, and spatially explicit\ngeo-bias evaluation framework that allows researchers to fairly compare the\ngeo-bias of different AI models and to understand what spatial factors\ncontribute to the geo-bias. In this paper, we establish an\ninformation-theoretic framework for geo-bias evaluation, called GeoBS (Geo-Bias\nScores). We demonstrate the generalizability of the proposed framework by\nshowing how to interpret and analyze existing geo-bias measures under this\nframework. Then, we propose three novel geo-bias scores that explicitly take\nintricate spatial factors (multi-scalability, distance decay, and anisotropy)\ninto consideration. Finally, we conduct extensive experiments on 3 tasks, 8\ndatasets, and 8 models to demonstrate that both task-specific GeoAI models and\ngeneral-purpose foundation models may suffer from various types of geo-bias.\nThis framework will not only advance the technical understanding of geographic\nbias but will also establish a foundation for integrating spatial fairness into\nthe design, deployment, and evaluation of AI systems."}

To\nmitigate this issue, we propose Expert-Assisted Policy Optimization (EAPO), a\nnovel RL framework that enhances exploration by incorporating multi-turn\ninteractions with external experts during training. Unlike prior methods, where\npolicies reason in isolation, EAPO incentivizes the policy to adaptively\ndetermine when and how to consult experts, yielding richer reward signals and\nmore reliable reasoning trajectories. External assistance ultimately\ninternalizes expert knowledge into the policy model, amplifying the model's\ninherent reasoning capabilities. During evaluation, the policy model has been\nwell-optimized to solve questions independently, producing improved reasoning\npaths and more accurate solutions. Experiments on mathematical reasoning\nbenchmarks, including AIME 2024, AIME 2025, and AIMO 2025, show that EAPO\nconsistently outperforms expert-assisted workflow, expert-distilled models, and\nRL baselines, with an average gain of 5 points over self-exploratory models."}

At the same time, emerging low-code and\ntemplate-based agent development platforms (e.g., Dify) enable users to rapidly\nbuild and orchestrate agentic systems, which we refer to as\nplatform-orchestrated agentic systems. However, these systems are also fragile\nand it remains unclear how to systematically identify their potential failure\nroot cause. This paper presents a study of root cause identification of these\nplatform-orchestrated agentic systems. To support this initiative, we construct\na dataset AgentFail containing 307 failure logs from ten agentic systems, each\nwith fine-grained annotations linking failures to their root causes. We\nadditionally utilize counterfactual reasoning-based repair strategy to ensure\nthe reliability of the annotation. Building on the dataset, we develop a\ntaxonomy that characterizes failure root causes and analyze their distribution\nacross different platforms and task domains. Furthermore, we introduce a\nbenchmark that leverages LLMs for automatically identifying root causes, in\nwhich we also utilize the proposed taxonomy as guidance for LLMs. Results show\nthat the taxonomy can largely improve the performance, thereby confirming its\nutility. Nevertheless, the accuracy of root cause identification reaches at\nmost 33.6%, which indicates that this task still remains challenging. In light\nof these results, we also provide actionable guidelines for building such\nagentic systems. In summary, this paper provides a reliable dataset of failure\nroot cause for platform-orchestrated agentic systems, corresponding taxonomy\nand benchmark, which serves as a foundation for advancing the development of\nmore reliable agentic systems."}

Its training combines\nthree advances: (i) DUETQA, a 5K-sample dataset generated via multi-agent\nself-play that enforces strict web-search dependence and heterogeneous source\ngrounding; (ii) RAPO, a zero-overhead extension of GRPO that stabilizes\nmulti-turn Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards through curriculum\npruning, reward-aware advantage scaling, and per-prompt replay buffers; and\n(iii) a steerable step-level reward that classifies each tool call by cognitive\nbehavior and marginal utility, enabling explicit control over search trajectory\nbreadth, depth, and horizon. These improvements enable reliable extension of\ntool-calling beyond 20 calls when warranted. The second is\nFathom-Synthesizer-4B, trained from Qwen3-4B, which converts multi-turn\nDeepSearch traces into structured, citation-dense DeepResearch Reports for\ncomprehensive synthesis. Evaluated on DeepSearch benchmarks (SimpleQA, FRAMES,\nWebWalker, Seal0, MuSiQue) and DeepResearch-Bench, the system achieves\nstate-of-the-art performance in the open-weights category while demonstrating\nstrong generalization to diverse reasoning tasks including HLE, AIME-25,\nGPQA-Diamond, and MedQA."}

However, these methods are all\nunderpinned by a critical, yet flawed assumption: human preferences are\nhomogeneous (representing a single, unified preference) and the collected data\nis noiseless (free from error). In reality, neither is true since human\npreference is pluralistic and annotators can make mistakes. This creates a\ndiscrepancy between the recorded data and the ground-truth preferences, which\ncan misguide the model and degrade its performance. To address this challenge,\nwe introduce Robust Preference Optimization (RPO). RPO employs an\nExpectation-Maximization (EM) algorithm to infer the posterior probability of\neach label's correctness, which is used to adaptively re-weigh each data point\nin the training loss to mitigate noise. We further generalize this approach by\nestablishing a theoretical link between arbitrary preference losses and their\ncorresponding probabilistic models. This generalization enables the systematic\ntransformation of existing alignment algorithms into their robust counterparts,\nelevating RPO from a specific algorithm to a meta-framework for robust\npreference alignment. Theoretically, we prove that under the condition of a\nperfectly calibrated model, RPO is guaranteed to converge to the true noise\nlevel of the dataset. Our experiments demonstrate RPO's effectiveness as a\nmeta-framework, consistently enhancing four state-of-the-art alignment\nalgorithms (DPO, IPO, SimPO, and CPO).

We prove that online\non-policy sampling better approximates the human-perceived distribution of what\nthe model can produce, and PPO/GRPO-style clipping -- originally introduced to\njust stabilize training -- recovers a perceptual bias in how humans perceive\nprobability. In this sense, PPO/GRPO act as perceptual losses already. Our\ntheory further suggests that the online/offline dichotomy is itself incidental\nto maximizing human utility, since we can achieve the same effect by\nselectively training on any data in a manner that mimics human perception,\nrather than restricting ourselves to online on-policy data. Doing so would\nallow us to post-train more quickly, cheaply, and flexibly without sacrificing\nperformance.

TSR-Suite is the first\ncomprehensive time series reasoning suite that supports not only thorough\nevaluation but also the data pipeline and training of TSRMs. It contains more\nthan 23K samples, of which 2.3K are carefully curated through a human-guided\nhierarchical annotation process. Building on this foundation, we introduce\nTimeOmni-1, the first unified reasoning model designed to address diverse\nreal-world problems demanding time series reasoning. The model is trained in\nmultiple stages, integrating a mixture of task scenarios, novel reward\nfunctions, and tailored optimizations. Experiments show that TimeOmni-1\ndelivers strong out-of-distribution generalization across all tasks and\nachieves a high rate of valid responses. It significantly improves causality\ndiscovery accuracy (64.0% vs. 35.9% with GPT-4.1) and raises the valid response\nrate by over 6% compared to GPT-4.1 on the event-aware forecasting task."}

Existing methods uncover global capability circuits\n(e.g., indirect object identification), but not why the model answers a\nspecific input query in a particular way. We introduce query circuits, which\ndirectly trace the information flow inside a model that maps a specific input\nto the output. Unlike surrogate-based approaches (e.g., sparse autoencoders),\nquery circuits are identified within the model itself, resulting in more\nfaithful and computationally accessible explanations. To make query circuits\npractical, we address two challenges. First, we introduce Normalized Deviation\nFaithfulness (NDF), a robust metric to evaluate how well a discovered circuit\nrecovers the model's decision for a specific input, and is broadly applicable\nto circuit discovery beyond our setting. Second, we develop sampling-based\nmethods to efficiently identify circuits that are sparse yet faithfully\ndescribe the model's behavior. Across benchmarks (IOI, arithmetic, MMLU, and\nARC), we find that there exist extremely sparse query circuits within the model\nthat can recover much of its performance on single queries. For example, a\ncircuit covering only 1.3% of model connections can recover about 60% of\nperformance on an MMLU questions. Overall, query circuits provide a step\ntowards faithful, scalable explanations of how language models process\nindividual inputs."}

We develop two complementary methods: (1) RLHI with User-Guided\nRewrites, which revises unsatisfactory model outputs based on users'\nnatural-language follow-up responses, (2) RLHI with User-Based Rewards, which\nlearns via a reward model conditioned on knowledge of the user's long-term\ninteraction history (termed persona). Together, these methods link long-term\nuser personas to turn-level preferences via persona-conditioned preference\noptimization. Trained on conversations derived from WildChat, both RLHI\nvariants outperform strong baselines in personalization and\ninstruction-following, and similar feedback enhances performance on reasoning\nbenchmarks. These results suggest organic human interaction offers scalable,\neffective supervision for personalized alignment."}

Our analysis reveals\nthat the challenges in VLM personalization (such as refusal behaviors and\nlong-context forgetting) highlight substantial room for improvement. By\nidentifying these limitations and offering a scalable benchmark, MMPB offers\nvaluable insights and a solid foundation for future research toward truly\npersonalized multi-modal AI.

Classical planners often generate\ninefficient, high-cost plans by shuffling objects individually and using fixed\nbuffers--temporary spaces such as empty table regions or static stacks--to\nresolve conflicts. When only free table locations are used as buffers, dense\nscenes become inefficient, since placing an object can restrict others from\nreaching their goals and complicate planning. Allowing stacking provides extra\nbuffer capacity, but conventional stacking is static: once an object supports\nanother, the base cannot be moved, which limits efficiency. To overcome these\nissues, a novel planning primitive called the Dynamic Buffer is introduced.\nInspired by human grouping strategies, it enables robots to form temporary,\nmovable stacks that can be transported as a unit. This improves both\nfeasibility and efficiency in dense layouts, and it also reduces travel in\nlarge-scale settings where space is abundant. Compared with a state-of-the-art\nrearrangement planner, the approach reduces manipulator travel cost by 11.89%\nin dense scenarios with a stationary robot and by 5.69% in large, low-density\nsettings with a mobile manipulator. Practicality is validated through\nexperiments on a Delta parallel robot with a two-finger gripper.

Our system utilizes IMU (Inertial Measurement Unit) sensors\nand an RGB-D camera, which are the most common modalities in HAR. We directly\ncollected a dataset through this system, investigated an appropriate preprocess\nand proposed a deep learning model suitable for processing multimodal data. We\nanalyzed the collected dataset and found that the action data of stroke\npatients is less clustering than that of non-disabled individuals.\nSimultaneously, we found that the proposed model learns similar tendencies for\neach label in data with features that are difficult to clustering. This study\nsuggests the possibility of expanding the deep learning model, which has\nlearned the action features of stroke patients, to not only simple action\nrecognition but also feedback such as assessment contributing to domiciliary\nrehabilitation in future research.

A fundamental challenge in these systems is\nstatistical heterogeneity-the fact that data distributions vary significantly\nacross clients (e.g., different hospitals may treat distinct patient\ndemographics). While current FL algorithms focus on aggregating model updates\nfrom these heterogeneous clients, the potential of the central server remains\nunder-explored. This paper is motivated by a healthcare scenario: could a\ncentral server not only build a model but also guide a new patient to the\nhospital best equipped for their specific condition? We generalize this idea to\npropose a novel paradigm for FL systems where the server actively guides the\nallocation of new tasks or queries to the most appropriate client in the\nnetwork. To enable this, we introduce an empirical likelihood-based framework\nthat simultaneously addresses two goals: (1) learning effective local models on\neach client, and (2) finding the best matching client for a new query.\nEmpirical results demonstrate the framework's effectiveness on benchmark\ndatasets, showing improvements in both model accuracy and the precision of\nclient guidance compared to standard FL approaches.

To\naddress these challenges, we propose WARBERT, a hierarchical BERT-based model\nfor Web API recommendation.

The final likelihood of a mashup being matched with an API is\ndetermined by combining the predictions from WARBERT(R) and WARBERT(M).\nAdditionally, WARBERT(R) incorporates an auxiliary task of mashup category\njudgment, which enhances its effectiveness in candidate selection.

Recently,\nfinetuning judges with judge-specific data has emerged as an often preferred\nchoice over directly prompting frontier models as judges, as the former\nachieves better performance with smaller model sizes while being more robust to\ncommon biases. However, the standard evaluation ignores several practical\nconcerns of finetuned judges regarding their real world deployment. In this\npaper, we identify and formalize three aspects that affect the shelf life of\nthese judges: future proofing and backward compatibility -- how well judges\nfinetuned on responses by today's generator models perform on responses by\nfuture models or past models, as well as question generalization -- how well\njudges generalize to unseen questions at test time. We study these three\naspects in the math domain under a unified framework with varying train and\ntest distributions, three SFT- and DPO-based finetuning algorithms and three\ndifferent base models. Experiments suggest that future-proofing is challenging\nfor most models, while backward compatibility is relatively easy, with\nDPO-trained models consistently improving performance. We further find that\ncontinual learning provides a more balanced adaptation to shifts between older\nand newer response distributions than training solely on stronger or weaker\nresponses. Moreover, all models observe certain degrees of performance\ndegradation when moving from questions seen during training to unseen ones,\nshowing that current judges do not fully generalize to unseen questions. These\nfindings provide insights into practical considerations for developing and\ndeploying judge models in the face of ever-changing generators."}

In this paper, we present the first study on\nultra-low bit (<4-bit) quantization for multimodal LLMs. Our analysis reveals\nthat multimodal tokens and intermediate layer activations produced by them\nexhibit significantly higher statistical variance and entropy compared to text\ntokens, making them less tolerant to ultra-low bit quantization.

We address\nthis gap through a logic-grounded evaluation framework that categorizes\nmultimodal reasoning into six interaction patterns, varying how facts are\ndistributed across modalities and logically combined.

However, such aggressive compression leads to\nsignificant accuracy degradation, even after costly quantization-aware training\nwith massive data. We identify the core issue as deadzone trapping: a large\nnumber of weights are trapped at the deadzone boundary.

Firstly, a contextual subdata\nsimilarity adaptive sensing strategy is designed for denoising centered on the\nLDCT projection domain, which provides an initial prior for the subsequent\nprogress. Subsequently, the initial prior is used to combine knowledge\ndistillation with a deep combination of latent diffusion models for optimizing\nimage details.

But the fact that this also occurs under hard distillation-where\nthe student only sees sampled tokens-raises a deeper question: when and how\ndoes subliminal learning actually occur? We answer this question through\ncontrolled experiments and mechanistic analysis. Our results show that\nsubliminal learning does not need (global) token entanglement or logit leakage.\nInstead, it comes down to a small set of divergence tokens-rare cases where\nteachers with different biases would predict different tokens.

While collecting and\nprocessing a large number of arbitrarily captured 2D images can be arduous in\nmany practical scenarios, a more efficient solution involves optimizing the\nplacement of available cameras in 3D space to capture fewer, yet more\ninformative, images that provide sufficient visual information for effective\nreconstruction of the environment of interest.

We revisit linguistic confidence (LC),\nwhere models express uncertainty through hedging language (e.g., probably,\nmight), offering a lightweight and human-centered alternative. To advance this\ndirection, we (1) release the first diverse, large-scale dataset of hedging\nexpressions with human-annotated confidence scores, and (2) propose a\nlightweight mapper that converts hedges into confidence scores at near-zero\ncost. Building on these resources, we (3) conduct the first systematic study of\nLC across modern LLMs and QA benchmarks, revealing that while most LLMs\nunderperform in expressing reliable LC, carefully designed prompting achieves\ncompetitive calibration and discriminability.

Using AI\nmodels as `cognitive agents,' we collected millions of triplet odd-one-out\njudgments from a multimodal large language model (MLLM) and a language-only\nmodel (LLM) in response to 2,180 emotionally evocative videos.

Project Page https://johann.wang/Light-SQ/", "summary": "In user-generated-content (UGC) applications, non-expert users often rely on\nimage-to-3D generative models to create 3D assets. In this context,\nprimitive-based shape abstraction offers a promising solution for UGC scenarios\nby compressing high-resolution meshes into compact, editable representations.\nTowards this end, effective shape abstraction must therefore be\nstructure-aware, characterized by low overlap between primitives, part-aware\nalignment, and primitive compactness. We present Light-SQ, a novel\nsuperquadric-based optimization framework that explicitly emphasizes\nstructure-awareness from three aspects. (a) We introduce SDF carving to\niteratively udpate the target signed distance field, discouraging overlap\nbetween primitives. (b) We propose a block-regrow-fill strategy guided by\nstructure-aware volumetric decomposition, enabling structural partitioning to\ndrive primitive placement. (c) We implement adaptive residual pruning based on\nSDF update history to surpress over-segmentation and ensure compact results. In\naddition, Light-SQ supports multiscale fitting, enabling localized refinement\nto preserve fine geometric details. To evaluate our method, we introduce\n3DGen-Prim, a benchmark extending 3DGen-Bench with new metrics for both\nreconstruction quality and primitive-level editability.

Prior research has often framed confidence as a problem of eliciting\na model's \"self-knowledge\", i.e., the ability of an LLM to judge whether its\nown answers are correct; this approach implicitly assumes that there is some\nprivileged information about the answer's correctness that is accessible to the\nmodel itself. However, our experiments reveal that an LLM attempting to predict\nthe correctness of its own outputs generally performs no better than an\nunrelated LLM. Moreover, we hypothesize that a key factor in building a\n\"Correctness Model\" (CM) is exposure to a target model's historical\npredictions. We propose multiple methods to inject this historical correctness\ninformation, creating a Generalized Correctness Model (GCM). We first show that\nGCMs can be trained on the correctness data from many LLMs and learn patterns\nfor correctness prediction applicable across datasets and models. We then use\nCMs as a lens for studying the source of correctness prediction ability and its\ngeneralization, systematically controlling their training data and finding that\nanswer phrasing is a strong predictor for correctness. We further explore\nalternative methods of injecting history without training an LLM, finding that\nincluding history as in-context examples can help improve correctness\nprediction, and post-hoc calibration can provide complementary reductions in\ncalibration error. We evaluate GCMs based on Qwen3-8B across 5 model families\nand the MMLU and TriviaQA datasets, as well as on a downstream selective\nprediction task, finding that reliable LLM confidence estimation is a\ngeneralizable and model-agnostic skill learned by systematically encoding\ncorrectness history rather than a model-specific skill reliant on\nself-introspection."}

We evaluate the effectiveness of our data pipeline by measuring\nthe average number of tool calls required to correctly answer a question, and\nalso show that our agent yields better performance when equipped with our\ntools. Our \\mbox{InfoAgent} is post-trained from Qwen3-14B using a two-stage\nrecipe: cold-start supervised finetuning to instill long-horizon search\nbehaviors, followed by reinforcement learning which significantly improves\nreasoning-driven tool use. With our methods, InfoAgent achieves 15.3\\% accuracy\non BrowseComp, 29.2\\% on BrowseComp-ZH, and 40.4\\% on Xbench-DS, outperforming\nprior open-source deep research agents such as WebSailor-72B and DeepDive-32B."}
