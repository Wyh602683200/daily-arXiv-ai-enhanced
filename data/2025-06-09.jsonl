To provide a\nstructured foundation, the paper draws on Basic Formal Ontology (BFO) and other\napplied ontological methods to differentiate various senses of love. This work\nengages with objections to the understanding of love as concatenation,\nparticularly concerning the relationship between sensation and judgment.

Despite significant advances in\nmemory components such as RAG, vector stores, and LLM agents, these systems\nstill have substantial memory limitations. Gen AI workflows rarely store or\nreflect on the full context in which decisions are made. This leads to repeated\nerrors and a general lack of clarity. This paper introduces Contextual Memory\nIntelligence (CMI) as a new foundational paradigm for building intelligent\nsystems. It repositions memory as an adaptive infrastructure necessary for\nlongitudinal coherence, explainability, and responsible decision-making rather\nthan passive data. Drawing on cognitive science, organizational theory,\nhuman-computer interaction, and AI governance, CMI formalizes the structured\ncapture, inference, and regeneration of context as a fundamental system\ncapability. The Insight Layer is presented in this paper to operationalize this\nvision. This modular architecture uses human-in-the-loop reflection, drift\ndetection, and rationale preservation to incorporate contextual memory into\nsystems. The paper argues that CMI allows systems to reason with data, history,\njudgment, and changing context, thereby addressing a foundational blind spot in\ncurrent AI architectures and governance efforts. A framework for creating\nintelligent systems that are effective, reflective, auditable, and socially\nresponsible is presented through CMI. This enhances human-AI collaboration,\ngenerative AI design, and the resilience of the institutions."}

At\nepsilon=0.5, 5 epochs: FERRET-EIGHTH achieves 3.98 perplexity vs DPSGD's 11.61\n(2.9x better), within 23% of Non-DP (3.25).\n  Privacy: MI-AUC stays at chance for FERRET-MAX/EIGHTH (~0.51), matching DPSGD\nvs Non-DP's 0.76-0.99. FERRET-2 shows higher leakage (~0.55) due to lower\nheadroom.\n  Efficiency: Stricter budgets fire fewer signs, so FERRET uses 19-33% of\nDPSGD's training time and only 34-36% of Non-DP training time.\n  Take-away: Sign-based MI-DP gets closer to achieving all three qualities of\nthe privacy, utility, performance trilemma: FERRET trains up to 5x faster,\nachieves 3x lower perplexity compared to DPSGD and 1.2x greater than Non-DP,\nall while providing formal, mathematically provable privacy guarantees using\nzero additive noise. The results also show that, in certain instances, masked\n1-bit updates can match non-private training utility while safeguarding data."}

Vector Quantization (VQ), a\nclustering-based quantization method, serves as a prevalent solution to this\nissue for its extremely low-bit (even at 2-bit) and considerable accuracy.\nSince a vector is a quantity in mathematics and physics that has both direction\nand magnitude, existing VQ works typically quantize them in a coupled manner.\nHowever, we find that direction exhibits significantly greater sensitivity to\nquantization compared to the magnitude. For instance, when separately\nclustering the directions and magnitudes of weight vectors in LLaMA-2-7B, the\naccuracy drop of zero-shot tasks are 46.5\\% and 2.3\\%, respectively.

In contrast to existing VLMs with over 7B parameters and\nunstructured language processing(e.g., LLaVA-1.5), FastDrive understands\nstructured and concise descriptions and generates machine-friendly driving\ndecisions with high efficiency. Extensive experiments show that FastDrive\nachieves competitive performance on structured dataset, with approximately 20%\naccuracy improvement on decision-making tasks, while surpassing massive\nparameter baseline in inference speed with over 10x speedup. Additionally,\nablation studies further focus on the impact of scene annotations (e.g.,\nweather, time of day) on decision-making tasks, demonstrating their importance\non decision-making tasks in autonomous driving."}

We depart from this paradigm by studying CP in a\nquery only setting, where prediction sets must be constructed solely from\nfinite queries to a black box generative model, introducing a new trade off\nbetween coverage, test time query budget, and informativeness. We introduce\nConformal Prediction with Query Oracle (CPQ), a framework characterizing the\noptimal interplay between these objectives.

However, an\ninterpretable comparison of different embeddings requires identifying and\nanalyzing mismatches between sample groups clustered within the embedding\nspaces. In this work, we propose the \\emph{Spectral Pairwise Embedding\nComparison (SPEC)} framework to compare embeddings and identify their\ndifferences in clustering a reference dataset. Our approach examines the kernel\nmatrices derived from two embeddings and leverages the eigendecomposition of\nthe difference kernel matrix to detect sample clusters that are captured\ndifferently by the two embeddings. We present a scalable implementation of this\nkernel-based approach, with computational complexity that grows linearly with\nthe sample size. Furthermore, we introduce an optimization problem using this\nframework to align two embeddings, ensuring that clusters identified in one\nembedding are also captured in the other model. We provide numerical results\ndemonstrating the SPEC's application to compare and align embeddings on\nlarge-scale datasets such as ImageNet and MS-COCO.

Yet, a critical gap persists,\n`conceptualization'-the ability to recognize and reason about the same concept\ndespite variations in visual form, a basic ability of human reasoning. To\naddress this challenge, we introduce the Visual Graph Arena (VGA), a dataset\nfeaturing six graph-based tasks designed to evaluate and improve AI systems'\ncapacity for visual abstraction. VGA uses diverse graph layouts (e.g.,\nKamada-Kawai vs. planar) to test reasoning independent of visual form.\nExperiments with state-of-the-art vision models and multimodal LLMs reveal a\nstriking divide: humans achieved near-perfect accuracy across tasks, while\nmodels totally failed on isomorphism detection and showed limited success in\npath/cycle tasks. We further identify behavioral anomalies suggesting\npseudo-intelligent pattern matching rather than genuine understanding. These\nfindings underscore fundamental limitations in current AI models for visual\nunderstanding. By isolating the challenge of representation-invariant\nreasoning, the VGA provides a framework to drive progress toward human-like\nconceptualization in AI visual models.

(2) Existing evaluations focus\nsolely on the UI code generation task, whereas practical UI development\ninvolves several iterations, including refining editing, and repairing issues.\n(3) Current benchmarks employ unidimensional evaluation, lacking investigation\ninto influencing factors like task difficulty, input context variations, and\nin-depth code-level analysis. To bridge these gaps, we introduce DesignBench, a\nmulti-framework, multi-task evaluation benchmark for assessing MLLMs'\ncapabilities in automated front-end engineering. DesignBench encompasses three\nwidely-used UI frameworks (React, Vue, and Angular) alongside vanilla HTML/CSS,\nand evaluates on three essential front-end tasks (generation, edit, and repair)\nin real-world development workflows. DesignBench contains 900 webpage samples\nspanning over 11 topics, 9 edit types, and 6 issue categories, enabling\ndetailed analysis of MLLM performance across multiple dimensions.

We explore an alternative: training a smaller KV cache offline on\neach corpus. At inference time, we load this trained KV cache, which we call a\nCartridge, and decode a response. Critically, the cost of training a Cartridge\ncan be amortized across all the queries referencing the same corpus. However,\nwe find that the naive approach of training the Cartridge with next-token\nprediction on the corpus is not competitive with ICL. Instead, we propose\nself-study, a training recipe in which we generate synthetic conversations\nabout the corpus and train the Cartridge with a context-distillation objective.\nWe find that Cartridges trained with self-study replicate the functionality of\nICL, while being significantly cheaper to serve. On challenging long-context\nbenchmarks, Cartridges trained with self-study match ICL performance while\nusing 38.6x less memory and enabling 26.4x higher throughput.

This is true even for the idealized unlearning\nmethod of training to imitate an oracle model that was never exposed to\nunwanted information, suggesting that output-based finetuning is insufficient\nto achieve robust unlearning. In a similar vein, we find that training a\nrandomly initialized student to imitate an unlearned model transfers desired\nbehaviors while leaving undesired capabilities behind. In other words,\ndistillation robustifies unlearning. Building on this insight, we propose\nUnlearn-Noise-Distill-on-Outputs (UNDO), a scalable method that distills an\nunlearned model into a partially noised copy of itself. UNDO introduces a\ntunable tradeoff between compute cost and robustness, establishing a new Pareto\nfrontier on synthetic language and arithmetic tasks. At its strongest setting,\nUNDO matches the robustness of a model retrained from scratch with perfect data\nfiltering while using only 60-80% of the compute and requiring only 0.01% of\nthe pretraining data to be labeled. We also show that UNDO robustifies\nunlearning on the more realistic Weapons of Mass Destruction Proxy (WMDP)\nbenchmark.

At a high level,\neigenspectrum analysis of DNNs involves measuring the heavytailness of the\nempirical spectral densities (ESD) of weight matrices. It provides insight into\nhow well a model is trained and can guide decisions on assigning better\nlayer-wise training hyperparameters. In this paper, we address a challenge\nassociated with such eigenspectrum methods: the impact of the aspect ratio of\nweight matrices on estimated heavytailness metrics. We demonstrate that\nmatrices of varying sizes (and aspect ratios) introduce a non-negligible bias\nin estimating heavytailness metrics, leading to inaccurate model diagnosis and\nlayer-wise hyperparameter assignment. To overcome this challenge, we propose\nFARMS (Fixed-Aspect-Ratio Matrix Subsampling), a method that normalizes the\nweight matrices by subsampling submatrices with a fixed aspect ratio. Instead\nof measuring the heavytailness of the original ESD, we measure the average ESD\nof these subsampled submatrices. We show that measuring the heavytailness of\nthese submatrices with the fixed aspect ratio can effectively mitigate the\naspect ratio bias. We validate our approach across various optimization\ntechniques and application domains that involve eigenspectrum analysis of\nweights, including image classification in computer vision (CV) models,\nscientific machine learning (SciML) model training, and large language model\n(LLM) pruning. Our results show that despite its simplicity, FARMS uniformly\nimproves the accuracy of eigenspectrum analysis while enabling more effective\nlayer-wise hyperparameter assignment in these application domains. In one of\nthe LLM pruning experiments, FARMS reduces the perplexity of the LLaMA-7B model\nby 17.3% when compared with the state-of-the-art method."}
