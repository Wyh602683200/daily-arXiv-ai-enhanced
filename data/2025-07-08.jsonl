However, the probe trained on the hidden states of one dataset often\nstruggles to generalise to another dataset of a different task or domain. To\naddress this limitation, we explore combining data-agnostic features with\nhidden-state features and assess whether this hybrid feature set enhances\nout-of-domain performance. We further examine whether selecting only the most\ninformative hidden-state features, thereby discarding task-specific noise,\nenables the data-agnostic features to contribute more effectively. The\nexperiment results indicate that although introducing data-agnostic features\ngenerally enhances generalisation performance in most cases, in certain\nscenarios their inclusion degrades performance.

Our Dual-task Autoregressive Imitation\nLearning (DARIL) baseline achieves 34.6% action triplet recognition mAP and\n33.6% next frame prediction mAP with smooth planning degradation to 29.2% at\n10-second horizons. We evaluated three RL variants: world model-based RL,\ndirect video RL, and inverse RL enhancement. Surprisingly, all RL approaches\nunderperformed DARIL i.e. world model RL dropped to 3.1% mAP at 10s while\ndirect video RL achieved only 15.9%. Our analysis reveals that distribution\nmatching on expert-annotated test sets systematically favors IL over\npotentially valid RL policies that differ from training demonstrations. This\nchallenges assumptions about RL superiority in sequential decision making and\nprovides crucial insights for surgical AI development."}

The teacher\nmodel follows an encoder-latent evolution-decoder architecture, where its\nlatent evolution module decouples high-frequency details and low-frequency\ntrends using convolution and Transformer (global low-frequency modeler).\nHowever, the multi-layer convolution and deconvolution structures result in\nslow training and high memory usage. To address these issues, we propose a\nfrequency-aligned knowledge distillation strategy, which extracts multi-scale\nspectral features from the teacher's latent space, including both high and low\nfrequency components, to guide the lightweight student model in capturing both\nlocal fine-grained variations and global evolution patterns. Experimental\nresults show that SDKD significantly improves performance, achieving reductions\nof up to 81.3% in MSE and in MAE 52.3% on the Navier-Stokes equation dataset.\nThe framework effectively captures both high-frequency variations and long-term\ntrends while reducing computational complexity.

We present these notions\nin a framework-agnostic way using the language of category theory, and adapt a\nseries of tests for compositional generalisation to this setting.\n  Applying this to the DisCoCirc framework, we consider how well a selection of\nmodels can learn to compositionally generalise. We compare both quantum circuit\nbased models, as well as classical neural networks, on a dataset derived from\none of the bAbI tasks, extended to test a series of aspects of\ncompositionality. Both architectures score within 5% of one another on the\nproductivity and substitutivity tasks, but differ by at least 10% for the\nsystematicity task, and exhibit different trends on the overgeneralisation\ntasks.

To address this challenge, we introduce Temporal\nSearch, a training-free framework that enables MLLMs to explore temporal\nregions for improved long video understanding iteratively. TS is based on a key\nobservation: the model's generation confidence across different temporal\nintervals is highly correlated with prediction accuracy. TS operates through\ntwo main iterative stages. First, the MLLM proposes a temporal interval that is\nlikely to contain task-relevant information. Then, it samples a fixed number of\nframes from the interval, regardless of length, and feeds them into the model\nto produce a refined response and confidence score. TS refines the focus of the\nmodel by iteratively shifting attention to more fine-grained temporal\nintervals, improving its understanding of long videos. Additionally,\nkeyframe-level descriptions are collected to facilitate cross-interval\nperception throughout the video. To further improve efficiency, we introduce\nTS-BFS, a best-first search strategy over a tree.

Due to these concerns,\nthis work explores the use of Named-Entity Recognition (NER) to facilitate the\nprivacy-preserving training (or adaptation) of LLMs. We propose a framework\nthat uses NER technologies to anonymize sensitive information in text data,\nsuch as personal identities or geographic locations. An evaluation of the\nproposed privacy-preserving learning framework was conducted to measure its\nimpact on user privacy and system performance in a particular high-stakes and\nsensitive setup: AI-based resume scoring for recruitment processes. The study\ninvolved two language models (BERT and RoBERTa) and six anonymization\nalgorithms (based on Presidio, FLAIR, BERT, and different versions of GPT)\napplied to a database of 24,000 candidate profiles. The findings indicate that\nthe proposed privacy preservation techniques effectively maintain system\nperformance while playing a critical role in safeguarding candidate\nconfidentiality, thus promoting trust in the experimented scenario. On top of\nthe proposed privacy-preserving approach, we also experiment applying an\nexisting approach that reduces the gender bias in LLMs, thus finally obtaining\nour proposed Privacy- and Bias-aware LLMs (PB-LLMs). Note that the proposed\nPB-LLMs have been evaluated in a particular setup (resume scoring), but are\ngenerally applicable to any other LLM-based AI application."}

Then we select the trial with the lowest perplexity score viewed\nas the most probable and reliable trial path given the model's capacity. The\ntrial number is negatively correlated with the prediction confidence, i.e., the\nless confident the model is, the more trials it should sample. This is\nconsistent with human beings' behaviour: when feeling uncertain or unconfident,\none tends to think more creatively, exploring multiple thinking paths, to\ncautiously select the path one feels most confident about. Extensive\nexperiments on both LLMs and MLLMs show that our proposed CNTP approach\noutperforms existing standard decoding strategies consistently by a clear\nmargin. Moreover, the integration of CNTP with self consistency can further\nimprove over vanilla self consistency. We believe our proposed CNTP has the\npotential to become one of the default choices for LLM decoding. Code is\navailable at https://github.com/wyzjack/CNTP."}

To address this challenge, we propose\nOptimas, a unified framework for effective optimization of compound systems.\nThe core idea of Optimas is to maintain one Local Reward Function (LRF) per\ncomponent, each satisfying a local-global alignment property, i.e., each\ncomponent's local reward correlates with the global system performance. In each\niteration, Optimas efficiently adapts the LRFs to maintain this property while\nsimultaneously maximizing each component's local reward. This approach enables\nindependent updates of heterogeneous configurations using the designated\noptimization method, while ensuring that local improvements consistently lead\nto performance gains. We present extensive evaluations across five real-world\ncompound systems to demonstrate that Optimas outperforms strong baselines by an\naverage improvement of 11.92%, offering a general and effective approach for\nimproving compound systems.

In the brain, neuromodulators such as\nacetylcholine and noradrenaline relieve this tension by tuning neuronal gain\nand inhibitory gating, balancing segregation and integration of circuits. Fed\nby dense cholinergic and noradrenergic projections from the ascending arousal\nsystem, layer-5 pyramidal neurons in the cerebral cortex offer a relevant\nsubstrate for understanding these dynamics. When distal dendritic signals\ncoincide with back-propagating action potentials, calcium plateaus turn a\nsingle somatic spike into a high-gain burst, and interneuron inhibition sculpts\nthe output. These properties make layer-5 cells gain-tunable amplifiers that\ntranslate neuromodulatory cues into flexible cortical activity. To capture this\nmechanism we developed a two-compartment Izhikevich model for pyramidal neurons\nand single-compartment somatostatin (SOM) and parvalbumin (PV) interneurons,\nlinked by Gaussian connectivity and spike-timing-dependent plasticity (STDP).\nThe soma and apical dendrite are so coupled that somatic spikes back-propagate,\nwhile dendritic plateaus can switch the soma from regular firing to bursting by\nshifting reset and adaptation variables. We show that stronger dendritic drive\nor tighter coupling raise gain by increasing the likelihood of\ncalcium-triggered somatic bursts. In contrast, dendritic-targeted inhibition\nsuppresses gain, while somatic-targeted inhibition raises the firing threshold\nof neighboring neurons, thus gating neurons output.

While attacks readily achieve high\nsuccess (>80\\% Attack Success Rate, ASR) on FP16 models, within an attack\nbudget of 25 perturbations, FP8 and INT8 models exhibit ASRs below 20\\% and\n50\\%, respectively. Increasing the perturbation budget up to 150 bit-flips, FP8\nmodels maintained ASR below 65\\%, demonstrating some resilience compared to\nINT8 and INT4 models that have high ASR. In addition, analysis of perturbation\nlocations revealed differing architectural targets across quantization schemes,\nwith (FP16, INT4) and (INT8, FP8) showing similar characteristics. Besides,\njailbreaks induced in FP16 models were highly transferable to subsequent\nFP8/INT8 quantization (<5\\% ASR difference), though INT4 significantly reduced\ntransferred ASR (avg. 35\\% drop). These findings highlight that while common\nquantization schemes, particularly FP8, increase the difficulty of direct\nparameter manipulation jailbreaks, vulnerabilities can still persist,\nespecially through post-attack quantization."}

Our\nframework, built upon a frozen Segment Anything Model (SAM) encoder,\nincorporates two synergistic innovations. First, Linguistic Adversarial\nDisentanglement (LAD) employs a Vision-Language Model to generate rich, textual\ndescriptions of confounding image styles. By training the segmentation model's\nfeatures to be contrastively dissimilar to these style descriptions, it learns\na representation robustly purged of non-causal information. Second, Test-Time\nCausal Intervention (TCI) provides an interactive mechanism where an LLM\ninterprets a clinician's natural language command to modulate the segmentation\ndecoder's features in real-time, enabling targeted error correction. We conduct\nan extensive empirical evaluation on a composite benchmark from four public\ndatasets (BTCV, CHAOS, AMOS, BraTS), assessing generalization under\ncross-scanner, cross-modality, and cross-anatomy settings. Causal-SAM-LLM\nestablishes a new state of the art in out-of-distribution (OOD) robustness,\nimproving the average Dice score by up to 6.2 points and reducing the Hausdorff\nDistance by 15.8 mm over the strongest baseline, all while using less than 9%\nof the full model's trainable parameters.

As distance increases, intensified scattering leads to severe\nhaze and signal loss, making it impractical to recover distant details solely\nfrom visible images. Near-infrared, with superior fog penetration, offers\ncritical complementary cues through multimodal fusion. However, existing\nmethods focus on content integration while often neglecting haze embedded in\nvisible images, leading to results with residual haze. In this work, we argue\nthat the infrared and visible modalities not only provide complementary\nlow-level visual features, but also share high-level semantic consistency.\nMotivated by this, we propose a Hierarchical Semantic-Visual Fusion (HSVF)\nframework, comprising a semantic stream to reconstruct haze-free scenes and a\nvisual stream to incorporate structural details from the near-infrared\nmodality. The semantic stream first acquires haze-robust semantic prediction by\naligning modality-invariant intrinsic representations. Then the shared\nsemantics act as strong priors to restore clear and high-contrast distant\nscenes under severe haze degradation. In parallel, the visual stream focuses on\nrecovering lost structural details from near-infrared by fusing complementary\ncues from both visible and near-infrared images.

Given the\ncritical need for transparent research into the LSLMs and empathetic behavior,\nwe present OpenS2S, a fully open-source, transparent and end-to-end LSLM\ndesigned to enable empathetic speech interactions. Based on our empathetic\nspeech-to-text model BLSP-Emo, OpenS2S further employs a streaming interleaved\ndecoding architecture to achieve low-latency speech generation. To facilitate\nend-to-end training, OpenS2S incorporates an automated data construction\npipeline that synthesizes diverse, high-quality empathetic speech dialogues at\nlow cost. By leveraging large language models to generate empathetic content\nand controllable text-to-speech systems to introduce speaker and emotional\nvariation, we construct a scalable training corpus with rich paralinguistic\ndiversity and minimal human supervision. We release the fully open-source\nOpenS2S model, including the dataset, model weights, pre-training and\nfine-tuning codes, to empower the broader research community and accelerate\ninnovation in empathetic speech systems.

Current approaches to value alignment, which rely on centralized,\ntop-down definitions, lack the mechanisms for meaningful contestability. This\nleaves users and communities unable to challenge or shape the values embedded\nin the systems that govern their digital lives, creating a crisis of legitimacy\nand trust. This paper introduces Community-Defined AI Value Pluralism (CDAVP),\na socio-technical framework that addresses this gap. It reframes the design\nproblem from achieving a single aligned state to infrastructuring a dynamic\necosystem for value deliberation and application. At its core, CDAVP enables\ndiverse, self-organizing communities to define and maintain explicit value\nprofiles - rich, machine-readable representations that can encompass not only\npreferences but also community-specific rights and duties. These profiles are\nthen contextually activated by the end-user, who retains ultimate control\n(agency) over which values guide the AI's behavior. AI applications, in turn,\nare designed to transparently interpret these profiles and moderate conflicts,\nadhering to a set of non-negotiable, democratically-legitimated meta-rules. The\ndesigner's role shifts from crafting static interfaces to becoming an architect\nof participatory ecosystems. We argue that infrastructuring for pluralism is a\nnecessary pathway toward achieving robust algorithmic accountability and\ngenuinely contestable, human-centric AI."}

This dilemma of conflicting\nrankings hampers model selection, clouds model comparisons, and adds confusion\nto a growing ecosystem of competing models. Recent work attributed ranking\ndisagreement to the phenomenon of training on the test task: As released,\ndifferent models exhibit a different level of preparation for any given test\ntask. A candidate solution to the problem is train-before-test: Give each model\nthe same benchmark-specific finetuning before evaluation. Our primary\ncontribution is a broad empirical evaluation of train-before-test across 24\nbenchmarks and 61 models. We show that train-before-test significantly improves\nranking agreement consistently across all benchmarks. Whereas rankings have\nlittle external validity to start with, they enjoy a significant degree of\nexternal validity when applying train-before-test: Model rankings transfer\ngracefully from one benchmark to the other. Even within the same model family,\ntrain-before-test reduces strong ranking disagreement to near-perfect\nagreement. In addition, train-before-test reduces the model-score matrix to\nessentially rank one, revealing new insights into the latent factors of\nbenchmark performance. Our work supports the recommendation to make\ntrain-before-test a default component of LLM benchmarking."}

To address this challenge, we propose\nEmbodieDreamer, a novel framework that reduces the Real2Sim2Real gap from both\nthe physics and appearance perspectives.

In this work, we\nintroduce CTA (Cross-Task Alignment), a novel approach for improving TTT.\nUnlike existing TTT methods, CTA does not require a specialized model\narchitecture and instead takes inspiration from the success of multi-modal\ncontrastive learning to align a supervised encoder with a self-supervised one.\nThis process enforces alignment between the learned representations of both\nmodels, thereby mitigating the risk of gradient interference, preserving the\nintrinsic robustness of self-supervised learning and enabling more semantically\nmeaningful updates at test-time.

In this study, we introduce and evaluate two novel\nstructured action space modification strategies for RL in autonomous driving:\ndynamic masking and relative action space reduction. These approaches are\nsystematically compared against fixed reduction schemes and full action space\nbaselines to assess their impact on policy learning and performance. Our\nframework leverages a multimodal Proximal Policy Optimization agent that\nprocesses both semantic image sequences and scalar vehicle states. The proposed\ndynamic and relative strategies incorporate real-time action masking based on\ncontext and state transitions, preserving action consistency while eliminating\ninvalid or suboptimal choices. Through comprehensive experiments across diverse\ndriving routes, we show that action space reduction significantly improves\ntraining stability and policy performance. The dynamic and relative schemes, in\nparticular, achieve a favorable balance between learning speed, control\nprecision, and generalization.

In this\npaper, we identify four core competencies essential for memory agents: accurate\nretrieval, test-time learning, long-range understanding, and conflict\nresolution. Existing datasets either rely on limited context lengths or are\ntailored for static, long-context settings like book-based QA, which do not\nreflect the interactive, multi-turn nature of memory agents that incrementally\naccumulate information. Furthermore, no existing benchmarks cover all four\ncompetencies. Therefore, we introduce MemoryAgentBench, a new benchmark\nspecifically designed for memory agents. Our benchmark combines reformulated\nexisting datasets with newly constructed ones, covering the above four memory\ncompetencies, providing a systematic and challenging testbed for assessing\nmemory quality. We evaluate a diverse set of memory agents, ranging from simple\ncontext-based and retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) systems to advanced\nagents with external memory modules and tool integration.
