While behavioral game theory (BGT) provides a framework for analyzing behavior, existing models do not fully capture the idiosyncratic behavior of humans or black-box, non-human agents like LLMs. We employ AlphaEvolve, a cutting-edge program discovery tool, to directly discover interpretable models of human and LLM behavior from data, thereby enabling open-ended discovery of structural factors driving human and LLM behavior. Our analysis on iterated rock-paper-scissors reveals that frontier LLMs can be capable of deeper strategic behavior than humans. These results provide a foundation for understanding structural differences driving differences in human and LLM behavior in strategic interactions."}

However, existing medical benchmarks remain static, suffering from two critical limitations: (1) data contamination, where test sets inadvertently leak into training corpora, leading to inflated performance estimates; and (2) temporal misalignment, failing to capture the rapid evolution of medical knowledge. Furthermore, current evaluation metrics for open-ended clinical reasoning often rely on either shallow lexical overlap (e.g., ROUGE) or subjective LLM-as-a-Judge scoring, both inadequate for verifying clinical correctness. To bridge these gaps, we introduce LiveMedBench, a continuously updated, contamination-free, and rubric-based benchmark that weekly harvests real-world clinical cases from online medical communities, ensuring strict temporal separation from model training data. We propose a Multi-Agent Clinical Curation Framework that filters raw data noise and validates clinical integrity against evidence-based medical principles. For evaluation, we develop an Automated Rubric-based Evaluation Framework that decomposes physician responses into granular, case-specific criteria, achieving substantially stronger alignment with expert physicians than LLM-as-a-Judge. To date, LiveMedBench comprises 2,756 real-world cases spanning 38 medical specialties and multiple languages, paired with 16,702 unique evaluation criteria. Extensive evaluation of 38 LLMs reveals that even the best-performing model achieves only 39.2%, and 84% of models exhibit performance degradation on post-cutoff cases, confirming pervasive data contamination risks. Error analysis further identifies contextual application-not factual knowledge-as the dominant bottleneck, with 35-48% of failures stemming from the inability to tailor medical knowledge to patient-specific constraints."}

However, RL suffers from sample inefficiency and a lack of semantic interpretability in complex scenarios. Foundation Models, particularly Vision-Language Models (VLMs), can mitigate this by offering rich, context-aware knowledge, yet their high inference latency hinders deployment in high-frequency RL training loops. To bridge this gap, we present Found-RL, a platform tailored to efficiently enhance RL for AD using foundation models. A core innovation is the asynchronous batch inference framework, which decouples heavy VLM reasoning from the simulation loop, effectively resolving latency bottlenecks to support real-time learning. We introduce diverse supervision mechanisms: Value-Margin Regularization (VMR) and Advantage-Weighted Action Guidance (AWAG) to effectively distill expert-like VLM action suggestions into the RL policy. Additionally, we adopt high-throughput CLIP for dense reward shaping. We address CLIP's dynamic blindness via Conditional Contrastive Action Alignment, which conditions prompts on discretized speed/command and yields a normalized, margin-based bonus from context-specific action-anchor scoring. Found-RL provides an end-to-end pipeline for fine-tuned VLM integration and shows that a lightweight RL model can achieve near-VLM performance compared with billion-parameter VLMs while sustaining real-time inference (approx. 500 FPS). Code, data, and models will be publicly available at https://github.com/ys-qu/found-rl."}

Our contributions are: (i) AgoraBench, a new benchmark spanning nine challenging settings (e.g., deception, monopoly) that supports diverse strategy modeling; (ii) human-aligned, economically grounded metrics derived from utility theory. This is operationalized via agent utility, negotiation power, and acquisition ratio that implicitly measure how well the negotiation aligns with human preference and (iii) a human preference grounded dataset with learning pipeline that strengthens LLMs' bargaining ability through both prompting and finetuning.

We propose a prompt protocol: input a GP domain and training tasks to LLMs, prompting them to generate abstract features and further abstract the initial state, action set, and goal into QNP problems. An automated debugging method is designed to detect abstraction errors, guiding LLMs to fix abstractions. Experiments demonstrate that under properly guided by automated debugging, some LLMs can generate useful QNP abstractions."}

Recent work introduces dynamic vocabulary by sampling retrieved text spans but overlooks that the same sentence can be composed of spans of varying lengths, lacking explicit modeling of the directed acyclic graph (DAG) state space. This leads to restricted exploration of compositional paths and is biased toward the chosen path. Generative Flow Networks (GFlowNets) are powerful for efficient exploring and generalizing over state spaces, particularly those with a DAG structure. However, prior GFlowNets-based language models operate at the token level and remain confined to tree-structured spaces, limiting their potential. In this work, we propose Flow of SpanS (FOSS), a principled GFlowNets framework for span generation. FoSS constructs a dynamic span vocabulary by segmenting the retrieved text flexibly, ensuring a DAG-structured state space, which allows GFlowNets to explore diverse compositional paths and improve generalization. With specialized reward models, FoSS generates diverse, high-quality text. Empirically, FoSS improves MAUVE scores by up to 12.5% over Transformer on text generation and achieves 3.5% gains on knowledge-intensive tasks, consistently outperforming state-of-the-art methods. Scaling experiments further demonstrate FoSS benefits from larger models, more data, and richer retrieval corpora, retaining its advantage over strong baselines."}

Based on the learned symbolic model of states, NSAM learns action masks that rules out infeasible actions. NSAM enables end-to-end integration of symbolic reasoning and deep policy optimization, where improvements in symbolic grounding and policy learning mutually reinforce each other.

Although recent progress in Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) has boosted step-by-step inference in mathematics and coding, it is still underexplored whether this benefit transfers to socio-cognitive skills. We present a systematic study of nine advanced Large Language Models (LLMs), comparing reasoning models with non-reasoning models on three representative ToM benchmarks. The results show that reasoning models do not consistently outperform non-reasoning models and sometimes perform worse. A fine-grained analysis reveals three insights. First, slow thinking collapses: accuracy significantly drops as responses grow longer, and larger reasoning budgets hurt performance. Second, moderate and adaptive reasoning benefits performance: constraining reasoning length mitigates failure, while distinct success patterns demonstrate the necessity of dynamic adaptation. Third, option matching shortcut: when multiple choice options are removed, reasoning models improve markedly, indicating reliance on option matching rather than genuine deduction. We also design two intervention approaches: Slow-to-Fast (S2F) adaptive reasoning and Think-to-Match (T2M) shortcut prevention to further verify and mitigate the problems. With all results, our study highlights the advancement of LRMs in formal reasoning (e.g., math, code) cannot be fully transferred to ToM, a typical task in social reasoning. We conclude that achieving robust ToM requires developing unique capabilities beyond existing reasoning methods."}

Although useful, task-specific modeling often increases training costs and limits generalization across behavioral settings. Recent reasoning RL methods facilitate training a single unified model across multiple behavioral tasks, but do not explicitly address learning across different heterogeneous behavioral data. To address this gap, we introduce Heterogeneity-Aware Relative Policy Optimization (HARPO), an RL method that balances leaning across heterogeneous tasks and samples. This is achieved by modulating advantages to ensure that no single task or sample carries disproportionate influence during policy optimization. Using HARPO, we develop and release Omnisapiens-7B 2.0, a foundation model for social behavior processing. Relative to existing behavioral foundation models, Omnisapiens-7B 2.0 achieves the strongest performance across behavioral tasks, with gains of up to +16.85% and +9.37% on multitask and held-out settings respectively, while producing more explicit and robust reasoning traces. We also validate HARPO against recent RL methods, where it achieves the most consistently strong performance across behavioral tasks."}

However, fine-tuning these models with Reinforcement Learning (RL) often suffers from a fundamental probability-reward mismatch. Conventional likelihood-dominated decoding (e.g., beam search) exhibits a myopic bias toward locally probable prefixes, which causes two critical failures: (1) insufficient exploration, where high-reward items in low-probability branches are prematurely pruned and rarely sampled, and (2) advantage compression, where trajectories sharing high-probability prefixes receive highly correlated rewards with low within-group variance, yielding a weak comparative signal for RL. To address these challenges, we propose V-STAR, a Value-guided Sampling and Tree-structured Advantage Reinforcement framework. V-STAR forms a self-evolving loop via two synergistic components. First, a Value-Guided Efficient Decoding (VED) is developed to identify decisive nodes and selectively deepen high-potential prefixes. This improves exploration efficiency without exhaustive tree search. Second, we propose Sibling-GRPO, which exploits the induced tree topology to compute sibling-relative advantages and concentrates learning signals on decisive branching decisions. Extensive experiments on both offline and online datasets demonstrate that V-STAR outperforms state-of-the-art baselines, delivering superior accuracy and candidate-set diversity under strict latency constraints."}

In addition, the EU AI Act requires universities to ensure regulatory compliance when deploying cognitive systems. These developments highlight the need for institutions to engage stakeholders and tailor GenAI integration to their needs while addressing concerns. This study investigates how GenAI is perceived within the disciplines of Information Technology and Electrical Engineering (ITEE). Using a mixed-method approach, we surveyed 61 staff and 37 students at the Faculty of ITEE, University of Oulu. The results reveal both shared and discipline-specific themes, including strong interest in programming support from GenAI and concerns over response quality, privacy, and academic integrity. Drawing from these insights, the study identifies a set of high-level requirements and proposes a conceptual framework for responsible GenAI integration. Disciplinary-specific requirements reinforce the importance of stakeholder engagement when integrating GenAI into higher education. The high-level requirements and the framework provide practical guidance for universities aiming to harness GenAI while addressing stakeholder concerns and ensuring regulatory compliance."}

Grounded in the Use-Modify-Create pedagogical framework, ScratchWorld comprises 83 curated tasks spanning four distinct problem categories: Create, Debug, Extend, and Compute. To rigorously diagnose the source of agent failures, the benchmark employs two complementary interaction modes: primitive mode requires fine-grained drag-and-drop manipulation to directly assess visuomotor control, while composite mode uses high-level semantic APIs to disentangle program reasoning from GUI execution. To ensure reliable assessment, we propose an execution-based evaluation protocol that validates the functional correctness of the constructed Scratch programs through runtime tests within the browser environment. Extensive experiments across state-of-the-art multimodal language models and GUI agents reveal a substantial reasoning--acting gap, highlighting persistent challenges in fine-grained GUI manipulation despite strong planning capabilities."}

A Study of Cultural Novelty in Recipe Generation", "categories": ["cs.AI"], "comment": "14 pages, 12 figures, conference", "summary": "Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly used to generate and shape cultural content, ranging from narrative writing to artistic production. While these models demonstrate impressive fluency and generative capacity, prior work has shown that they also exhibit systematic cultural biases, raising concerns about stereotyping, homogenization, and the erasure of culturally specific forms of expression. Understanding whether LLMs can meaningfully align with diverse cultures beyond the dominant ones remains a critical challenge. In this paper, we study cultural adaptation in LLMs through the lens of cooking recipes, a domain in which culture, tradition, and creativity are tightly intertwined. We build on the \\textit{GlobalFusion} dataset, which pairs human recipes from different countries according to established measures of cultural distance. Using the same country pairs, we generate culturally adapted recipes with multiple LLMs, enabling a direct comparison between human and LLM behavior in cross-cultural content creation. Our analysis shows that LLMs fail to produce culturally representative adaptations. Unlike humans, the divergence of their generated recipes does not correlate with cultural distance. We further provide explanations for this gap. We show that cultural information is weakly preserved in internal model representations, that models inflate novelty in their production by misunderstanding notions such as creativity and tradition, and that they fail to identify adaptation with its associated countries and to ground it in culturally salient elements such as ingredients. These findings highlight fundamental limitations of current LLMs for culturally oriented generation and have important implications for their use in culturally sensitive applications."}

We present GameDevBench, the first benchmark for evaluating agents on game development tasks. GameDevBench consists of 132 tasks derived from web and video tutorials. Tasks require significant multimodal understanding and are complex -- the average solution requires over three times the amount of lines of code and file changes compared to prior software development benchmarks. Agents still struggle with game development, with the best agent solving only 54.5% of tasks. We find a strong correlation between perceived task difficulty and multimodal complexity, with success rates dropping from 46.9% on gameplay-oriented tasks to 31.6% on 2D graphics tasks. To improve multimodal capability, we introduce two simple image and video-based feedback mechanisms for agents.

We argue that formal verification offers a principled escape from this dilemma, yet its adoption has been hindered by a critical bottleneck: the translation from natural language requirements to formal specifications. This paper bridges this gap by proposing , a neuro-symbolic framework that employs a bidirectional Formal-of-Thought architecture: LLMs serve as specification compilers that top-down decompose high-level human intent into atomic, verifiable constraints, then bottom-up prove compliance using Dafny specifications and Z3 Satisfiability modulo theories solving, which produces mathematical guarantees rather than probabilistic scores. We validate across three benchmarks spanning behavioral safety, multi-domain constraint adherence, and agentic upward deception detection. Experiments on 7 agent models demonstrate that achieves an average improvement of 16.6% over LLM-as-a-Judge baselines, enables weak-to-strong generalization where a 7B judge achieves over 90% accuracy detecting deception from 72B agents, and provides near-linear safety improvement through iterative refinement."}

We evaluated encoder (BERT, NYUTron) and generative (Llama-3.1-8B, MedGemma-4B) LLMs, in both frozen and fine-tuned settings, for discharge and 90-day mRS prediction using a large, real-world stroke registry. The discharge outcome dataset included 9,485 History and Physical notes and the 90-day outcome dataset included 1,898 notes from the NYU Langone Get With The Guidelines-Stroke registry (2016-2025). Data were temporally split with the most recent 12 months held out for testing. Performance was assessed using exact (7-class) mRS accuracy and binary functional outcome (mRS 0-2 vs. 3-6) accuracy and compared against established structured-data baselines incorporating NIHSS and age. Fine-tuned Llama achieved the highest performance, with 90-day exact mRS accuracy of 33.9% [95% CI, 27.9-39.9%] and binary accuracy of 76.3% [95% CI, 70.7-81.9%].

As these systems mature, they have the potential to automate a substantial share of manual organizational processes, fundamentally reshaping how work is designed, executed, and governed. Although many organizations have adopted AI to improve productivity, most implementations remain limited to isolated use cases and human-centered, tool-driven workflows. Despite increasing awareness of agentic AI's strategic importance, engineering teams and organizational leaders often lack clear guidance on how to operationalize it effectively. Key challenges include an overreliance on traditional software engineering practices, limited integration of business-domain knowledge, unclear ownership of AI-driven workflows, and the absence of sustainable human-AI collaboration models. Consequently, organizations struggle to move beyond experimentation, scale agentic systems, and align them with tangible business value. Drawing on practical experience in designing and deploying agentic AI workflows across multiple organizations and business domains, this paper proposes a pragmatic framework for transitioning organizational functions from manual processes to automated agentic AI systems. The framework emphasizes domain-driven use case identification, systematic delegation of tasks to AI agents, AI-assisted construction of agentic workflows, and small, AI-augmented teams working closely with business stakeholders. Central to the approach is a human-in-the-loop operating model in which individuals act as orchestrators of multiple AI agents, enabling scalable automation while maintaining oversight, adaptability, and organizational control."}

To understand the behavior of AI agents in the agent-native community, in this paper, we present a large-scale empirical analysis of Moltbook leveraging a dataset of 44,411 posts and 12,209 sub-communities (\"submolts\") collected prior to February 1, 2026. Leveraging a topic taxonomy with nine content categories and a five-level toxicity scale, we systematically analyze the topics and risks of agent discussions. Our analysis answers three questions: what topics do agents discuss (RQ1), how risk varies by topic (RQ2), and how topics and toxicity evolve over time (RQ3). We find that Moltbook exhibits explosive growth and rapid diversification, moving beyond early social interaction into viewpoint, incentive-driven, promotional, and political discourse. The attention of agents increasingly concentrates in centralized hubs and around polarizing, platform-native narratives. Toxicity is strongly topic-dependent: incentive- and governance-centric categories contribute a disproportionate share of risky content, including religion-like coordination rhetoric and anti-humanity ideology. Moreover, bursty automation by a small number of agents can produce flooding at sub-minute intervals, distorting discourse and stressing platform stability. Overall, our study underscores the need for topic-sensitive monitoring and platform-level safeguards in agent social networks."}

The complexity of the underlying physics and the heterogeneity of experimental data pose formidable challenges for conventional numerical methods, while simultaneously highlights the promise of modern data-native AI approaches. A major obstacle in realizing this potential is, however, the lack of curated, openly available datasets and standardized benchmarks. Existing fusion datasets are scarce, fragmented across institutions, facility-specific, and inconsistently annotated, which limits reproducibility and prevents a fair and scalable comparison of AI approaches. In this paper, we introduce TokaMark, a structured benchmark to evaluate AI models on real experimental data collected from the Mega Ampere Spherical Tokamak (MAST). TokaMark provides a comprehensive suite of tools designed to (i) unify access to multi-modal heterogeneous fusion data (ii) harmonize formats, metadata, temporal alignment and evaluation protocols to enable consistent cross-model and cross-task comparisons. The benchmark includes a curated list of 14 tasks spanning a range of physical mechanisms, exploiting a variety of diagnostics and covering multiple target use cases. A baseline model is provided to facilitate transparent comparison and validation within a unified framework. By establishing a unified benchmark for both the fusion and AI-for-science communities, TokaMark aims to accelerate progress in data-driven plasma AI modeling, contributing to the broader goal of achieving sustainable and stable fusion energy.

A key barrier is security: the inherently nondeterministic behavior of LLM agents defies static auditing approaches that have historically underpinned software assurance. Existing security methods, such as proxy-level input filtering and model glassboxing, fail to provide sufficient transparency or traceability into agent reasoning, state changes, or environmental interactions. In this work, we introduce AgentTrace, a dynamic observability and telemetry framework designed to fill this gap. AgentTrace instruments agents at runtime with minimal overhead, capturing a rich stream of structured logs across three surfaces: operational, cognitive, and contextual. Unlike traditional logging systems, AgentTrace emphasizes continuous, introspectable trace capture, designed not just for debugging or benchmarking, but as a foundational layer for agent security, accountability, and real-time monitoring.

Existing defenses either reduce UI exposure, obfuscate only task-irrelevant content, or rely on user authorization, but none can protect task-critical sensitive information while preserving seamless agent usability.\n  We propose an anonymization-based privacy protection framework that enforces the principle of available-but-invisible access to sensitive data: sensitive information remains usable for task execution but is never directly visible to the cloud-based agent. Our system detects sensitive UI content using a PII-aware recognition model and replaces it with deterministic, type-preserving placeholders (e.g., PHONE_NUMBER#a1b2c) that retain semantic categories while removing identifying details. A layered architecture comprising a PII Detector, UI Transformer, Secure Interaction Proxy, and Privacy Gatekeeper ensures consistent anonymization across user instructions, XML hierarchies, and screenshots, mediates all agent actions over anonymized interfaces, and supports narrowly scoped local computations when reasoning over raw values is necessary.\n  Extensive experiments on the AndroidLab and PrivScreen benchmarks show that our framework substantially reduces privacy leakage across multiple models while incurring only modest utility degradation, achieving the best observed privacy-utility trade-off among existing methods."}

Optimization approaches include theoretically lossless methods and others without accuracy guarantees like quantization. In all of these cases it is crucial to ensure that the model quality has not degraded. However, even at temperature zero, model generations are not necessarily robust even to theoretically lossless model optimizations due to numerical errors. We thus require statistical tools to decide whether a finite-sample accuracy deviation is an evidence of a model's degradation or whether it can be attributed to (harmless) noise in the evaluation. We propose a statistically sound hypothesis testing framework based on McNemar's test allowing to efficiently detect model degradations, while guaranteeing a controlled rate of false positives. The crucial insight is that we have to confront the model scores on each sample, rather than aggregated on the task level. Furthermore, we propose three approaches to aggregate accuracy estimates across multiple benchmarks into a single decision. We provide an implementation on top of the largely adopted open source LM Evaluation Harness and provide a case study illustrating that the method correctly flags degraded models, while not flagging model optimizations that are provably lossless. We find that with our tests even empirical accuracy degradations of 0.3% can be confidently attributed to actual degradations rather than noise."}

The framework specifies when contributors should speak, what they should report, and when silence is preferable. Using simulation-based aggregation, we show that prediction accuracy improves over an all-own baseline across a broad region of the parameter space, conditional on items where routing applies. Importantly, these gains arise only when silence is allowed, enabling second-order signals to function effectively. The results demonstrate that collective intelligence in matters of taste depends on principled signal routing rather than simple averaging."}

To our best knowledge, NMRTrans is the first NMR Transformer trained solely on large-scale experimental spectra and achieves state-of-the-art performance on experimental benchmarks, improving Top-10 Accuracy over the strongest baseline by +17.82 points (61.15% vs. 43.33%), and underscoring the importance of experimental data and structure-aware architectures for reliable NMR structure elucidation."}

Our experiments on two advanced agents, Transfuser and Interfuser, reveal severe vulnerabilities to such attacks, with driving scores dropping by up to 99% in the worst case, raising valid safety concerns. To help mitigate such threats, we further propose a lightweight Attack Detection model for Autonomous Driving systems (AD$^2$) based on attention mechanisms that capture spatial-temporal consistency.

However, existing code benchmarks primarily emphasize static correctness and implicitly assume fixed model capability during inference. As a result, they do not capture inference-time self-evolution, such as whether accuracy and efficiency improve as an agent iteratively refines its solutions. They also provide limited accounting of resource costs and rarely calibrate model performance against that of human programmers. Moreover, many benchmarks are dominated by high-resource languages, leaving cross-language robustness and long-tail language stability underexplored. Therefore, we present EvoCodeBench, a benchmark for evaluating self-evolving LLM-driven coding systems across programming languages with direct comparison to human performance. EvoCodeBench tracks performance dynamics, measuring solution correctness alongside efficiency metrics such as solving time, memory consumption, and improvement algorithmic design over repeated problem-solving attempts. To ground evaluation in a human-centered reference frame, we directly compare model performance with that of human programmers on the same tasks, enabling relative performance assessment within the human ability distribution. Furthermore, EvoCodeBench supports multiple programming languages, enabling systematic cross-language and long-tail stability analyses under a unified protocol. Our results demonstrate that self-evolving systems exhibit measurable gains in efficiency over time, and that human-relative and multi-language analyses provide insights unavailable through accuracy alone.

In this work, we propose Vision-Centric Jailbreak Attack (VJA), the first visual-to-visual jailbreak attack that conveys malicious instructions purely through visual inputs. To systematically study this emerging threat, we introduce IESBench, a safety-oriented benchmark for image editing models.

We term such reusable knowledge representations derived from past errors as meta-experience. Based on this insight, we propose Meta-Experience Learning (MEL), a novel framework that incorporates self-distilled meta-experience into the model's parametric memory. Building upon standard RLVR, we introduce an additional design that leverages the LLM's self-verification capability to conduct contrastive analysis on paired correct and incorrect trajectories, identify the precise bifurcation points where reasoning errors arise, and summarize them into generalizable meta-experience. The meta-experience is further internalized into the LLM's parametric memory by minimizing the negative log-likelihood, which induces a language-modeled reward signal that bridges correct and incorrect reasoning trajectories and facilitates effective knowledge reuse. Experimental results demonstrate that MEL achieves consistent improvements on benchmarks, yielding 3.92%--4.73% Pass@1 gains across varying model sizes."}

The quantum state is represented as an agent that performs state observation and learns a function of the state to make predictions via a parametric model. Under an ICO operation, the agent experiences a superposition of orders, one in which it performs state observation and then executes the required computation steps, and another in which the agent carries out the computation first and then performs state observation. This is distinct from prevailing information processing and machine intelligence paradigms where information acquisition and learning follow a strict causal order, with the former always preceding the latter. We provide experimental results and we show that the proposed scheme can achieve small training and testing losses on a representative task in magnetic navigation."}

A key challenge is estimating advantages for later blocks whose rewards are conditioned on sampled prefixes; standard unbiased approaches require expensive nested rollouts from intermediate states. Concretely, we introduce an Outcome-Conditioned Baseline that approximates intermediate state values using only within-group statistics by stratifying samples according to a prefix-derived intermediate outcome. On math tasks with uncertainty estimation, our method mitigates reward interference, is competitive with a state-of-the-art reward-designed approach, and preserves test-time gains from confidence-weighted ensembling.

We propose an alternative program parameterization that maintains the ability to construct optimal solutions while reducing the cognitive load on the LLM.

The optimum can then be approached by iteratively applying improve() and perturb() with a scheduled intensity. We evaluate ImprovEvolve on challenging problems from the AlphaEvolve paper: hexagon packing in a hexagon and the second autocorrelation inequality. For hexagon packing, the evolved program achieves new state-of-the-art results for 11, 12, 15, and 16 hexagons; a lightly human-edited variant further improves results for 14, 17, and 23 hexagons.

Amongst the highway traffic management strategies, jam-absorption driving (JAD), in which a dedicated vehicle performs \"slow-in\" and \"fast-out\" maneuvers before being captured by a stop-and-go wave, has been proposed as a potential method for preventing the propagation of such waves. However, most existing JAD strategies remain impractical mainly due to the lack of discussion regarding implementation vehicles and operational conditions. Inspired by real-world observations of police-car swerving behavior, this paper first introduces a Single-Vehicle Two-Detector Jam-Absorption Driving (SVDD-JAD) problem, and then proposes a practical JAD strategy that transforms such behavior into a maneuver capable of suppressing the propagation of an isolated stop-and-go wave. Five key parameters that significantly affect the proposed strategy, namely, JAD speed, inflow traffic speed, wave width, wave speed, and in-wave speed, are identified and systematically analyzed. Using a SUMO-based simulation as an illustrative example, we further demonstrate how these parameters can be measured in practice with two stationary roadside traffic detectors. The results show that the proposed JAD strategy successfully suppresses the propagation of a stop-and-go wave, without triggering a secondary wave. This paper is expected to take a significant step toward making JAD practical, advancing it from a theoretical concept to a feasible and implementable strategy.

Yet diagnosing their performance and reliability is difficult because data are fragmented and time-disjoint, and existing methods demand large datasets and expert input while offering only limited insights. Degradation arises not only from shifting workloads and evolving architectures but also from environmental factors such as temperature, humidity, and vibration. We present KORAL, a knowledge driven reasoning framework that integrates Large Language Models (LLMs) with a structured Knowledge Graph (KG) to generate insights into SSD operations. Unlike traditional approaches that require extensive expert input and large datasets, KORAL generates a Data KG from fragmented telemetry and integrates a Literature KG that already organizes knowledge from literature, reports, and traces. This turns unstructured sources into a queryable graph and telemetry into structured knowledge, and both the Graphs guide the LLM to deliver evidence-based, explainable analysis aligned with the domain vocabulary and constraints. Evaluation using real production traces shows that the KORAL delivers expert-level diagnosis and recommendations, supported by grounded explanations that improve reasoning transparency, guide operator decisions, reduce manual effort, and provide actionable insights to improve service quality. To our knowledge, this is the first end-to-end system that combines LLMs and KGs for full-spectrum SSD reasoning including Descriptive, Predictive, Prescriptive, and What-if analysis.

We follow up on previous works that have analyzed the complexity of BNSL w.r.t. the so-called superstructure of the input. While known results imply that BNSL is unlikely to be fixed-parameter tractable even when parameterized by the size of a vertex cover in the superstructure, here we show that a different kind of parameterization - notably by the size of a feedback edge set - yields fixed-parameter tractability. We proceed by showing that this result can be strengthened to a localized version of the feedback edge set, and provide corresponding lower bounds that complement previous results to provide a complexity classification of BNSL w.r.t. virtually all well-studied graph parameters.\n  We then analyze how the complexity of BNSL depends on the representation of the input. In particular, while the bulk of past theoretical work on the topic assumed the use of the so-called non-zero representation, here we prove that if an additive representation can be used instead then BNSL becomes fixed-parameter tractable even under significantly milder restrictions to the superstructure, notably when parameterized by the treewidth alone.

While state-of-the-art generative models can synthesize auxiliary views to provide additional supervision, these views inevitably contain geometric inconsistencies and textural misalignments that propagate and amplify artifacts during 3D reconstruction. To effectively harness these imperfect supervisory signals, we propose an adaptive optimization framework guided by excess risk decomposition, termed ERGO. Specifically, ERGO decomposes the optimization losses in 3D Gaussian splatting into two components, i.e., excess risk that quantifies the suboptimality gap between current and optimal parameters, and Bayes error that models the irreducible noise inherent in synthesized views. This decomposition enables ERGO to dynamically estimate the view-specific excess risk and adaptively adjust loss weights during optimization. Furthermore, we introduce geometry-aware and texture-aware objectives that complement the excess-risk-derived weighting mechanism, establishing a synergistic global-local optimization paradigm. Consequently, ERGO demonstrates robustness against supervision noise while consistently enhancing both geometric fidelity and textural quality of the reconstructed 3D content. Extensive experiments on the Google Scanned Objects dataset and the OmniObject3D dataset demonstrate the superiority of ERGO over existing state-of-the-art methods."}

Inference-Time Scaling in Language Models as Adaptive Resource Rationality", "categories": ["cs.CL", "cs.AI", "cs.LG"], "comment": null, "summary": "Human reasoning is shaped by resource rationality -- optimizing performance under constraints. Recently, inference-time scaling has emerged as a powerful paradigm to improve the reasoning performance of Large Language Models by expanding test-time computation. Specifically, instruction-tuned (IT) models explicitly generate long reasoning steps during inference, whereas Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) are trained by reinforcement learning to discover reasoning paths that maximize accuracy. However, it remains unclear whether resource-rationality can emerge from such scaling without explicit reward related to computational costs. We introduce a Variable Attribution Task in which models infer which variables determine outcomes given candidate variables, input-output trials, and predefined logical functions. By varying the number of candidate variables and trials, we systematically manipulate task complexity. Both models exhibit a transition from brute-force to analytic strategies as complexity increases. IT models degrade on XOR and XNOR functions, whereas LRMs remain robust. These findings suggest that models can adjust their reasoning behavior in response to task complexity, even without explicit cost-based reward. It provides compelling evidence that resource rationality is an emergent property of inference-time scaling itself."}

This challenge is relevant for traumatic bowel injury, a rare but high-mortality diagnosis. We investigated whether specificity deficits in foundation models are associated with heterogeneity in the negative class. Methods: This retrospective study used the multi-institutional, RSNA Abdominal Traumatic Injury CT dataset (2019-2023), comprising scans from 23 centres. Two foundation models (MedCLIP, zero-shot; RadDINO, linear probe) were compared against three task-specific approaches (CNN, Transformer, Ensemble). Models were trained on 3,147 patients (2.3% bowel injury prevalence) and evaluated on an enriched 100-patient test set. To isolate negative-class effects, specificity was assessed in patients without bowel injury who had concurrent solid organ injury (n=58) versus no abdominal pathology (n=50). Results: Foundation models achieved equivalent discrimination to task-specific models (AUC, 0.64-0.68 versus 0.58-0.64) with higher sensitivity (79-91% vs 41-74%) but lower specificity (33-50% vs 50-88%). All models demonstrated high specificity in patients without abdominal pathology (84-100%). When solid organ injuries were present, specificity declined substantially for foundation models (50-51 percentage points) compared with smaller reductions of 12-41 percentage points for task-specific models. Conclusion: Foundation models matched task-specific discrimination without task-specific training, but their specificity deficits were driven primarily by confounding negative-class heterogeneity rather than prevalence alone. Susceptibility to negative-class heterogeneity decreased progressively with labelled training, suggesting adaptation is required before clinical implementation."}

We argue that these inconsistencies stem from two overlooked bottlenecks: evidence alignment and sub-claim error profiles. To better understand these factors, we introduce a new dataset of real-world complex claims, featuring temporally bounded evidence and human-annotated sub-claim evidence spans. We evaluate decomposition under two evidence alignment setups: Sub-claim Aligned Evidence (SAE) and Repeated Claim-level Evidence (SRE). Our results reveal that decomposition brings significant performance improvement only when evidence is granular and strictly aligned. By contrast, standard setups that rely on repeated claim-level evidence (SRE) fail to improve and often degrade performance as shown across different datasets and domains (PHEMEPlus, MMM-Fact, COVID-Fact). Furthermore, we demonstrate that in the presence of noisy sub-claim labels, the nature of the error ends up determining downstream robustness. We find that conservative \"abstention\" significantly reduces error propagation compared to aggressive but incorrect predictions. These findings suggest that future claim decomposition frameworks must prioritize precise evidence synthesis and calibrate the label bias of sub-claim verification models."}

This necessitates treating timing as a true \\emph{computable} dimension, allowing models to assign ``relative timestamps'' to candidate events beyond their observed physical times.\n  In this work, we introduce LITT, a novel Timing-Transformer architecture that enables temporary alignment of sequential events on a virtual ``relative timeline'', thereby enabling \\emph{event-timing-focused attention} and personalized interpretations of clinical trajectories. Its interpretability and effectiveness are validated on real-world longitudinal EHR data from 3,276 breast cancer patients to predict the onset timing of cardiotoxicity-induced heart disease.

Using our DBPlanBench harness for the DataFusion engine, we expose the physical plan through a compact serialized representation and let the LLM propose localized edits that can be applied and executed. We then apply an evolutionary search over these edits to refine candidates across iterations. Our key insight is that LLMs can leverage semantic knowledge to identify and apply non-obvious optimizations, such as join orderings that minimize intermediate cardinalities. We obtain up to 4.78$\\times$ speedups on some queries and we demonstrate a small-to-large workflow in which optimizations found on small databases transfer effectively to larger databases."}

Building upon this metric, we further propose a diversity-driven data synthesis framework, named FAC Synthesis, that first uses a sparse autoencoder to identify missing features from a seed dataset, and then generates synthetic samples that explicitly reflect these features. Experiments show that our approach consistently improves both data diversity and downstream performance on various tasks, including instruction following, toxicity detection, reward modeling, and behavior steering.

To address this gap, we present LakeMLB (Data Lake Machine Learning Benchmark), designed for the most common multi-source, multi-table scenarios in data lakes. LakeMLB focuses on two representative multi-table scenarios, Union and Join, and provides three real-world datasets for each scenario, covering government open data, finance, Wikipedia, and online marketplaces. The benchmark supports three representative integration strategies: pre-training-based, data augmentation-based, and feature augmentation-based approaches. We conduct extensive experiments with state-of-the-art tabular learning methods, offering insights into their performance under complex data lake scenarios. We release both datasets and code to facilitate rigorous research on machine learning in data lake ecosystems; the benchmark is available at https://github.com/zhengwang100/LakeMLB."}

A key bottleneck is the lack of benchmarks that align natural-language specifications with reference formulations/solver code grounded in real optimization models. To fill in this gap, we introduce MIPLIB-NL, built via a structure-aware reverse construction methodology from real mixed-integer linear programs in MIPLIB~2017. Our pipeline (i) recovers compact, reusable model structure from flat solver formulations, (ii) reverse-generates natural-language specifications explicitly tied to this recovered structure under a unified model--data separation format, and (iii) performs iterative semantic validation through expert review and human--LLM interaction with independent reconstruction checks. This yields 223 one-to-one reconstructions that preserve the mathematical content of the original instances while enabling realistic natural-language-to-optimization evaluation.

Procedural alternatives introduce stepwise generation but often rely on mechanism-specific supervision, discrete symbolic edits, and computationally expensive inference. In this work, we propose LatentRxnFlow, a new reaction prediction paradigm that models reactions as continuous latent trajectories anchored at the thermodynamic product state. Built on Conditional Flow Matching, our approach learns time-dependent latent dynamics directly from standard reactant-product pairs, without requiring mechanistic annotations or curated intermediate labels. While LatentRxnFlow achieves state-of-the-art performance on USPTO benchmarks, more importantly, the continuous formulation exposes the full generative trajectory, enabling trajectory-level diagnostics that are difficult to realize with discrete or one-shot models. We show that latent trajectory analysis allows us to localize and characterize failure modes and to mitigate certain errors via gated inference. Furthermore, geometric properties of the learned trajectories provide an intrinsic signal of epistemic uncertainty, helping prioritize reliably predictable reaction outcomes and flag ambiguous cases for additional validation. Overall, LatentRxnFlow combines strong predictive accuracy with improved transparency, diagnosability, and uncertainty awareness, moving reaction prediction toward more trustworthy deployment in high-throughput discovery workflows."}

Existing methods attempt to reduce distributional shifts by aligning manually selected graph elements (e.g., node attributes or structural statistics), which typically require manually designed graph filters to extract relevant features before alignment. However, such approaches are inflexible: they rely on scenario-specific heuristics, and struggle when dominant discrepancies vary across transfer scenarios. To address these limitations, we propose \\textbf{ADAlign}, an Adaptive Distribution Alignment framework for GDA. Unlike heuristic methods, ADAlign requires no manual specification of alignment criteria. It automatically identifies the most relevant discrepancies in each transfer and aligns them jointly, capturing the interplay between attributes, structures, and their dependencies. This makes ADAlign flexible, scenario-aware, and robust to diverse and dynamically evolving shifts. To enable this adaptivity, we introduce the Neural Spectral Discrepancy (NSD), a theoretically principled parametric distance that provides a unified view of cross-graph shifts. NSD leverages neural characteristic function in the spectral domain to encode feature-structure dependencies of all orders, while a learnable frequency sampler adaptively emphasizes the most informative spectral components for each task via minimax paradigm. Extensive experiments on 10 datasets and 16 transfer tasks show that ADAlign not only outperforms state-of-the-art baselines but also achieves efficiency gains with lower memory usage and faster training."}

Our primary finding is that despite operating in high-dimensional parameter spaces ($d=128$), transformer training trajectories rapidly collapse onto low-dimensional execution manifolds of dimension $3$--$4$. This dimensional collapse is robust across random seeds and moderate task difficulties, though the orientation of the manifold in parameter space varies between runs. We demonstrate that this geometric structure underlies several empirically observed phenomena: (1) sharp attention concentration emerges as saturation along routing coordinates within the execution manifold, (2) stochastic gradient descent (SGD) exhibits approximately integrable dynamics when projected onto the execution subspace, with non-integrability confined to orthogonal staging directions, and (3) sparse autoencoders capture auxiliary routing structure but fail to isolate execution itself, which remains distributed across the low-dimensional manifold. Our results suggest a unifying geometric framework for understanding transformer learning, where the vast majority of parameters serve to absorb optimization interference while core computation occurs in a dramatically reduced subspace. These findings have implications for interpretability, training curriculum design, and understanding the role of overparameterization in neural network learning."}

The framework integrates (1) robust preprocessing, (2) Inter-Subject Balanced Channel Swap (ISBCS) for cross-subject augmentation, and (3) domain-adversarial training to suppress subject-specific bias. ISBCS randomly swaps channels between subjects to reduce inter-subject variability, and domain-adversarial training jointly encourages the model to learn task-relevant shared features. We validated the effectiveness of the proposed method through extensive experiments under cross-subject, cross-session, and cross-dataset settings.

Moreover, RoPE follows the prior that temporally closer image tokens are more causally related, leading to long-term decay in attention allocation and causing the model to progressively neglect earlier visual tokens as the sequence length increases. To address these issues, we propose C^2RoPE, an improved RoPE that explicitly models local spatial Continuity and spatial Causal relationships for visual processing. C^2RoPE introduces a spatio-temporal continuous positional embedding mechanism for visual tokens. It first integrates 1D temporal positions with Cartesian-based spatial coordinates to construct a triplet hybrid positional index, and then employs a frequency allocation strategy to encode spatio-temporal positional information across the three index components. Additionally, we introduce Chebyshev Causal Masking, which determines causal dependencies by computing the Chebyshev distance of image tokens in 2D space.

Despite large-scale multi-embodiment pre-training, existing Vision-Language-Action models (VLAs) remain tightly coupled to their training embodiments and typically require costly fine-tuning. We introduce Language-Action Pre-training (LAP), a simple recipe that represents low-level robot actions directly in natural language, aligning action supervision with the pre-trained vision-language model's input-output distribution. LAP requires no learned tokenizer, no costly annotation, and no embodiment-specific architectural design. Based on LAP, we present LAP-3B, which to the best of our knowledge is the first VLA to achieve substantial zero-shot transfer to previously unseen robot embodiments without any embodiment-specific fine-tuning. Across multiple novel robots and manipulation tasks, LAP-3B attains over 50% average zero-shot success, delivering roughly a 2x improvement over the strongest prior VLAs. We further show that LAP enables efficient adaptation and favorable scaling, while unifying action prediction and VQA in a shared language-action format that yields additional gains through co-training."}

Recent work MemAgent has tried to tackle this by processing context chunk-by-chunk in an RNN-like loop and updating a textual memory for final answering. However, this naive recurrent memory update faces two crucial drawbacks: (i) memory can quickly explode because it can update indiscriminately, even on evidence-free chunks; and (ii) the loop lacks an exit mechanism, leading to unnecessary computation after even sufficient evidence is collected. To address these issues, we propose GRU-Mem, which incorporates two text-controlled gates for more stable and efficient long-context reasoning. Specifically, in GRU-Mem, the memory only updates when the update gate is open and the recurrent loop will exit immediately once the exit gate is open. To endow the model with such capabilities, we introduce two reward signals $r^{\\text{update}}$ and $r^{\\text{exit}}$ within end-to-end RL, rewarding the correct updating and exiting behaviors respectively. Experiments on various long-context reasoning tasks demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of GRU-Mem, which generally outperforms the vanilla MemAgent with up to 400\\% times inference speed acceleration."}

To fill this gap, we propose MetaphorStar, the first end-to-end visual reinforcement learning (RL) framework for image implication tasks. Our framework includes three core components: the fine-grained dataset TFQ-Data, the visual RL method TFQ-GRPO, and the well-structured benchmark TFQ-Bench.\n  Our fully open-source MetaphorStar family, trained using TFQ-GRPO on TFQ-Data, significantly improves performance by an average of 82.6% on the image implication benchmarks.

This paradigm fails to update the model's internal representations based on search feedback, often yielding physically inconsistent or mathematically redundant expressions. In this work, we propose PiT-PO (Physics-informed Token-regularized Policy Optimization), a unified framework that evolves the LLM into an adaptive generator via reinforcement learning.

To improve stability, recent methods typically use a fixed sequence-level IS ratio for all tokens in a sequence or adjust each token's IS ratio separately, thereby neglecting temporal off-policy derivation across tokens in a sequence. In this paper, we first empirically identify that local off-policy deviation is structurally inconsistent at the token level, which may distort policy-gradient updates across adjacent tokens and lead to training collapse. To address the issue, we propose Online Causal Kalman Filtering for stable and effective Policy Optimization (KPO). Concretely, we model the desired IS ratio as a latent state that evolves across tokens and apply a Kalman filter to update this state online and autoregressively based on the states of past tokens, regardless of future tokens. The resulting filtered IS ratios preserve token-wise local structure-aware variation while strongly smoothing noise spikes, yielding more stable and effective policy updates. Experimentally, KPO achieves superior results on challenging math reasoning datasets compared with state-of-the-art counterparts."}

BNRM represents rewards through a sparse, non-negative latent factor generative process that operates at two complementary levels: instance-specific latent variables induce disentangled reward representations, while sparsity over global latent factors acts as an implicit debiasing mechanism that suppresses spurious correlations. Together, this disentanglement-then-debiasing structure enables robust uncertainty-aware reward learning. To scale BNRM to modern LLMs, we develop an amortized variational inference network conditioned on deep model representations, allowing efficient end-to-end training.

The lack of data typically results in artifacts in the reconstructed image and may even lead to object distortions. For this reason, the use of deep generative models in this context has great interest and potential success. In the Deep Generative Prior (DGP) framework, the use of diffusion-based generative models is combined with an iterative optimization algorithm for the reconstruction of CT images from sinograms acquired under sparse geometries, to maintain the explainability of a model-based approach while introducing the generative power of a neural network. There are therefore several aspects that can be further investigated within these frameworks to improve reconstruction quality, such as image generation, the model, and the iterative algorithm used to solve the minimization problem, for which we propose modifications with respect to existing approaches. The results obtained even under highly sparse geometries are very promising, although further research is clearly needed in this direction."}

This format supports early literacy and assists individuals with reading challenges, while also allowing general readers to seamlessly switch between reading and listening. With the emergence of natural-sounding neural Text-to-Speech (TTS) technology, several commercial services have been developed to leverage these technology for converting standard text e-books into high-quality narrated e-books. However, no open-source solutions currently exist to perform this task. In this paper, we present Calliope, an open-source framework designed to fill this gap. Our method leverages state-of-the-art open-source TTS to convert a text e-book into a narrated e-book in the EPUB 3 Media Overlay format. The method offers several innovative steps: audio timestamps are captured directly during TTS, ensuring exact synchronization between narration and text highlighting; the publisher's original typography, styling, and embedded media are strictly preserved; and the entire pipeline operates offline. This offline capability eliminates recurring API costs, mitigates privacy concerns, and avoids copyright compliance issues associated with cloud-based services. The framework currently supports the state-of-the-art open-source TTS systems XTTS-v2 and Chatterbox. A potential alternative approach involves first generating narration via TTS and subsequently synchronizing it with the text using forced alignment. However, while our method ensures exact synchronization, our experiments show that forced alignment introduces drift between the audio and text highlighting significant enough to degrade the reading experience.

In contrast to SR artifacts arising from synthetic LR images created under well-defined scenarios, those distortions are highly unpredictable and vary significantly across different real-life contexts. Consequently, assessing the quality of SR images (SR-IQA) obtained from realistic LR, remains a challenging and underexplored problem. In this work, we introduce a no-reference SR-IQA approach tailored for such highly ill-posed realistic settings. The proposed method enables domain-adaptive IQA for real-world SR applications, particularly in data-scarce domains. We hypothesize that degradations in super-resolved images are strongly dependent on the underlying SR algorithms, rather than being solely determined by image content. To this end, we introduce a self-supervised learning (SSL) strategy that first pretrains multiple SR model oriented representations in a pretext stage. Our contrastive learning framework forms positive pairs from images produced by the same SR model and negative pairs from those generated by different methods, independent of image content. The proposed approach S3 RIQA, further incorporates targeted preprocessing to extract complementary quality information and an auxiliary task to better handle the various degradation profiles associated with different SR scaling factors. To this end, we constructed a new dataset, SRMORSS, to support unsupervised pretext training; it includes a wide range of SR algorithms applied to numerous real LR images, which addresses a gap in existing datasets. Experiments on real SR-IQA benchmarks demonstrate that S3 RIQA consistently outperforms most state-of-the-art relevant metrics."}

A well-known vulnerability is a backdoor introduced into a neural network by poisoned training data or a malicious training process. Backdoors can be used to induce unwanted behavior by including a certain trigger in the input. Existing mitigations filter training data, modify the model, or perform expensive input modifications on samples. If a vulnerable model has already been deployed, however, those strategies are either ineffective or inefficient. To address this gap, we propose our inference-time backdoor mitigation approach called FIRE (Feature-space Inference-time REpair). We hypothesize that a trigger induces structured and repeatable changes in the model's internal representation. We view the trigger as directions in the latent spaces between layers that can be applied in reverse to correct the inference mechanism. Therefore, we turn the backdoored model against itself by manipulating its latent representations and moving a poisoned sample's features along the backdoor directions to neutralize the trigger. Our evaluation shows that FIRE has low computational overhead and outperforms current runtime mitigations on image benchmarks across various attacks, datasets, and network architectures."}

Such results often meet or exceed the baseline performance. However, these comparisons have two primary issues. First, they mostly considered only reliability as a comparison metric and selected a few LLMs (such as Codex and ChatGPT) for comparision. This paper proposes a comprehensive code quality assessment framework called Programmatic Excellence via LLM Iteration (PELLI). PELLI is an iterative analysis-based process that upholds high-quality code changes. We extended the state-of-the-art by performing a comprehensive evaluation that generates quantitative metrics for analyzing three primary nonfunctional requirements (such as maintainability, performance, and reliability) while selecting five popular LLMs. For PELLI's applicability, we selected three application domains while following Python coding standards. Following this framework, practitioners can ensure harmonious integration between LLMs and human developers, ensuring that their potential is fully realized. PELLI can serve as a practical guide for developers aiming to leverage LLMs while adhering to recognized quality standards. This study's outcomes are crucial for advancing LLM technologies in real-world applications, providing stakeholders with a clear understanding of where these LLMs excel and where they require further refinement. Overall, based on three nonfunctional requirements, we have found that GPT-4T and Gemini performed slightly better. We also found that prompt design can influence the overall code quality. In addition, each application domain demonstrated high and low scores across various metrics, and even within the same metrics across different prompts."}

In this paper, we present FlowCache, the first caching framework specifically designed for autoregressive video generation. Our key insight is that each video chunk should maintain independent caching policies, allowing fine-grained control over which chunks require recomputation at each timestep. We introduce a chunkwise caching strategy that dynamically adapts to the unique denoising characteristics of each chunk, complemented by a joint importance-redundancy optimized KV cache compression mechanism that maintains fixed memory bounds while preserving generation quality. Our method achieves remarkable speedups of 2.38 times on MAGI-1 and 6.7 times on SkyReels-V2, with negligible quality degradation (VBench: 0.87 increase and 0.79 decrease respectively).

Naive solutions, such as extending the historical window, lead to severe drawbacks, including overfitting, prohibitive computational costs, and redundant information processing. To address these challenges, we introduce the Global Temporal Retriever (GTR), a lightweight and plug-and-play module designed to extend any forecasting model's temporal awareness beyond the immediate historical context. GTR maintains an adaptive global temporal embedding of the entire cycle and dynamically retrieves and aligns relevant global segments with the input sequence. By jointly modeling local and global dependencies through a 2D convolution and residual fusion, GTR effectively bridges short-term observations with long-term periodicity without altering the host model architecture. Extensive experiments on six real-world datasets demonstrate that GTR consistently delivers state-of-the-art performance across both short-term and long-term forecasting scenarios, while incurring minimal parameter and computational overhead.

All experiments run on consumer-grade hardware (AMD Ryzen 7, 16GB RAM, no GPU). The evaluation spans four axes: (1) context length sensitivity from 24 to 2048 hours, (2) probabilistic forecast calibration, (3) robustness under distribution shifts including COVID-19 lockdowns and Winter Storm Uri, and (4) prescriptive analytics for operational decision support. The top-performing foundation models achieve MASE values near 0.31 at long context lengths (C = 2048h, day-ahead horizon), a 47% reduction over the Seasonal Naive baseline. The inclusion of Prophet exposes a structural advantage of pre-trained models: Prophet fails when the fitting window is shorter than its seasonality period (MASE > 74 at 24-hour context), while TSFMs maintain stable accuracy even with minimal context because they recognise temporal patterns learned during pre-training rather than estimating them from scratch. Calibration varies substantially across models--Chronos-2 produces well-calibrated prediction intervals (95% empirical coverage at 90% nominal level) while both Moirai-2 and Prophet exhibit overconfidence (~70% coverage).

Despite rapid advances in large language models (LLMs), it remains unclear whether they can meet the structural requirements of this process, which hinge on preserving roles, methods, and effect-size attribution across documents rather than on recognizing isolated entities. We propose a structural, diagnostic framework that evaluates LLM-based evidence extraction as a progression of schema-constrained queries with increasing relational and numerical complexity, enabling precise identification of failure points beyond atom-level extraction. Using a manually curated corpus spanning five scientific domains, together with a unified query suite and evaluation protocol, we evaluate two state-of-the-art LLMs under both per-document and long-context, multi-document input regimes. Across domains and models, performance remains moderate for single-property queries but degrades sharply once tasks require stable binding between variables, roles, statistical methods, and effect sizes. Full meta-analytic association tuples are extracted with near-zero reliability, and long-context inputs further exacerbate these failures. Downstream aggregation amplifies even minor upstream errors, rendering corpus-level statistics unreliable. Our analysis shows that these limitations stem not from entity recognition errors, but from systematic structural breakdowns, including role reversals, cross-analysis binding drift, instance compression in dense result sections, and numeric misattribution, indicating that current LLMs lack the structural fidelity, relational binding, and numerical grounding required for automated meta-analysis.

FinMMEval 2026 addresses this gap by offering three interconnected tasks that span financial understanding, reasoning, and decision-making: Financial Exam Question Answering, Multilingual Financial Question Answering (PolyFiQA), and Financial Decision Making.

Curriculum learning has proven to be effective in this setting, as it introduces complexity progressively. However, designing effective curricula is labor-intensive and requires extensive domain expertise. LLM-based curriculum generation has only recently emerged as a potential solution, but was limited to operate in static, offline modes without leveraging real-time feedback from the optimizer. Here we propose an interactive LLM-assisted framework for online curriculum generation, where the LLM adaptively designs training cases based on real-time feedback from the evolutionary optimization process. We investigate how different feedback modalities, ranging from numeric metrics alone to combinations with plots and behavior visualizations, influence the LLM ability to generate meaningful curricula. Through a 2D robot navigation case study, tackled with genetic programming as optimizer, we evaluate our approach against static LLM-generated curricula and expert-designed baselines. We show that interactive curriculum generation outperforms static approaches, with multimodal feedback incorporating both progression plots and behavior visualizations yielding performance competitive with expert-designed curricula. This work contributes to understanding how LLMs can serve as interactive curriculum designers for embodied AI systems, with potential extensions to broader evolutionary robotics applications."}

Current implementations predominantly rely on a \"Screen-as-Interface\" paradigm, which inherits structural vulnerabilities and conflicts with the mobile ecosystem's economic foundations. In this paper, we conduct a systematic security analysis of state-of-the-art mobile agents using Doubao Mobile Assistant as a representative case. We decompose the threat landscape into four dimensions - Agent Identity, External Interface, Internal Reasoning, and Action Execution - revealing critical flaws such as fake App identity, visual spoofing, indirect prompt injection, and unauthorized privilege escalation stemming from a reliance on unstructured visual data.\n  To address these challenges, we propose Aura, an Agent Universal Runtime Architecture for a clean-slate secure agent OS. Aura replaces brittle GUI scraping with a structured, agent-native interaction model. It adopts a Hub-and-Spoke topology where a privileged System Agent orchestrates intent, sandboxed App Agents execute domain-specific tasks, and the Agent Kernel mediates all communication. The Agent Kernel enforces four defense pillars: (i) cryptographic identity binding via a Global Agent Registry; (ii) semantic input sanitization through a multilayer Semantic Firewall; (iii) cognitive integrity via taint-aware memory and plan-trajectory alignment; and (iv) granular access control with non-deniable auditing. Evaluation on MobileSafetyBench shows that, compared to Doubao, Aura improves low-risk Task Success Rate from roughly 75% to 94.3%, reduces high-risk Attack Success Rate from roughly 40% to 4.4%, and achieves near-order-of-magnitude latency gains.

In public sector and civic AI systems, community contributions such as deliberations, annotations, prompts, and incident reports are often recorded informally, weakly linked to system updates, and disconnected from enforceable rights or sustained compensation. As a result, participation is frequently symbolic rather than accountable. We introduce the Participation Ledger, a machine readable and auditable framework that operationalizes participation as traceable influence, enforceable authority, and compensable labor. The ledger represents participation as an influence graph that links contributed artifacts to verified changes in AI systems, including datasets, prompts, adapters, policies, guardrails, and evaluation suites. It integrates three elements: a Participation Evidence Standard documenting consent, privacy, compensation, and reuse terms; an influence tracing mechanism that connects system updates to replayable before and after tests, enabling longitudinal monitoring of commitments; and encoded rights and incentives. Capability Vouchers allow authorized community stewards to request or constrain specific system capabilities within defined boundaries, while Participation Credits support ongoing recognition and compensation when contributed tests continue to provide value. We ground the framework in four urban AI and public space governance deployments and provide a machine readable schema, templates, and an evaluation plan for assessing traceability, enforceability, and compensation in practice."}

We provide the first large-scale evidence on this question by analyzing close to 2{,}500 statements submitted by 457 participants to an open-ended AI fact-checking system. Each claim is classified along five semantic dimensions (domain, epistemic form, verifiability, target entity, and temporal reference), producing a behavioral map of public verification demand. Three findings stand out. First, users range widely across topics but default to a narrow epistemic repertoire, overwhelmingly submitting simple descriptive claims about present-day observables. Second, roughly one in four requests concerns statements that cannot be empirically resolved, including moral judgments, speculative predictions, and subjective evaluations, revealing a systematic mismatch between what users seek from fact-checking tools and what such tools can deliver. Third, comparison with the FEVER benchmark dataset exposes sharp structural divergences across all five dimensions, indicating that standard evaluation corpora encode a synthetic claim environment that does not resemble real-world verification needs. These results reframe fact-checking as a demand-driven problem and identify where current AI systems and benchmarks are misaligned with the uncertainty people actually experience."}

To bridge the gap between phenomenological and computational approaches and overcome sample-size limitations, our research integrated three methodologies. Study A: structured phenomenological interviews with autistic individuals using the Transdiagnostic Assessment of Temporal Experience. Study B: computational analysis of an autobiographical corpus of autistic narratives built for this purpose. Study C: a replication of a computational study using narrative flow measures to assess the perceived phenomenological authenticity of autistic autobiographies. Interviews revealed that the most significant differences between the autistic and control groups concerned unpredictability of experience. Computational results mirrored these findings: the temporal lexicon in autistic narratives was significantly more negatively valenced - particularly the \"Immediacy & Suddenness\" category. Outlier analysis identified terms associated with perceived discontinuity (unpredictably, precipitously, and abruptly) as highly negative. The computational analysis of narrative flow found that the autistic narratives contained within the corpus quantifiably resemble autobiographical stories more than imaginary ones. Overall, the temporal challenges experienced by autistic individuals were shown to primarily concern lived unpredictability and stem from the contents of lived experience, and not from autistic narrative construction."}

Standard decoding follows a greedy rule: unmask the most confident positions, yet this local choice can lock the model into a suboptimal unmasking order, especially on reasoning-heavy prompts. We present SOAR, a training-free decoding algorithm that adapts its behavior to the model's uncertainty. When confidence is low, SOAR briefly widens the search over alternative unmasking decisions to avoid premature commitments; when confidence is high, it collapses the search and decodes many positions in parallel to reduce the number of denoising iterations. Across mathematical reasoning and code generation benchmarks (GSM8K, MBPP, HumanEval) on Dream-7B and LLaDA-8B, SOAR improves generation quality while maintaining competitive inference speed, offering a practical way to balance quality and efficiency in DLM decoding."}

In this work, we reinterpret RoPE as phase modulation applied to a bank of complex oscillators, enabling analysis through classical signal processing theory.\n  Under this formulation, we derive principled lower bounds on the RoPE base parameter that are necessary to preserve positional coherence over a target context length. These include a fundamental aliasing bound, analogous to a Nyquist limit, and a DC-component stability bound that constrains phase drift in low-frequency positional modes. We further extend this analysis to deep transformers, showing that repeated rotary modulation across layers compounds angular misalignment, tightening the base requirement as depth increases.\n  Complementing these results, we derive a precision-dependent upper bound on the RoPE base arising from finite floating-point resolution. Beyond this limit, incremental phase updates become numerically indistinguishable, leading to positional erasure even in the absence of aliasing. Together, the lower and upper bounds define a precision- and depth-dependent feasibility region a Goldilocks zone for long-context transformers.\n  We validate the framework through a comprehensive case study of state-of-the-art models, including LLaMA, Mistral, and DeepSeek variants, showing that observed successes, failures, and community retrofits align closely with the predicted bounds. Notably, models that violate the stability bound exhibit attention collapse and long-range degradation, while attempts to scale beyond one million tokens encounter a hard precision wall independent of architecture or training."}

As their presence grows, it becomes important to assess the current boundaries of their coding abilities. Existing agentic coding benchmarks, however, cover a limited task scope, e.g., bug fixing within a single pull request (PR), and often rely on non-executable evaluations or lack an automated approach for continually updating the evaluation coverage. To address such issues, we propose FeatureBench, a benchmark designed to evaluate agentic coding performance in end-to-end, feature-oriented software development. FeatureBench incorporates an execution-based evaluation protocol and a scalable test-driven method that automatically derives tasks from code repositories with minimal human effort. By tracing from unit tests along a dependency graph, our approach can identify feature-level coding tasks spanning multiple commits and PRs scattered across the development timeline, while ensuring the proper functioning of other features after the separation. Using this framework, we curated 200 challenging evaluation tasks and 3825 executable environments from 24 open-source repositories in the first version of our benchmark. Empirical evaluation reveals that the state-of-the-art agentic model, such as Claude 4.5 Opus, which achieves a 74.4% resolved rate on SWE-bench, succeeds on only 11.0% of tasks, opening new opportunities for advancing agentic coding. Moreover, benefiting from our automated task collection toolkit, FeatureBench can be easily scaled and updated over time to mitigate data leakage. The inherent verifiability of constructed environments also makes our method potentially valuable for agent training."}

Unlike pixel grids in images or sequential structures in language, graphs exhibit a typical non-Euclidean structure with complex interactions among the objects. This paper argues that Riemannian geometry provides a principled and necessary foundation for graph representation learning, and that Riemannian graph learning should be viewed as a unifying paradigm rather than a collection of isolated techniques. While recent studies have explored the integration of graph learning and Riemannian geometry, most existing approaches are limited to a narrow class of manifolds, particularly hyperbolic spaces, and often adopt extrinsic manifold formulations. We contend that the central mission of Riemannian graph learning is to endow graph neural networks with intrinsic manifold structures, which remains underexplored. To advance this perspective, we identify key conceptual and methodological gaps in existing approaches and outline a structured research agenda along three dimensions: manifold type, neural architecture, and learning paradigm. We further discuss open challenges, theoretical foundations, and promising directions that are critical for unlocking the full potential of Riemannian graph learning. This paper aims to provide a coherent viewpoint and to stimulate broader exploration of Riemannian geometry as a foundational framework for future graph learning research."}

Nonetheless, it faces persistent challenges, including the pre-selection of an optimal rank and rank-specific hyper-parameters, as well as the deployment complexity of heterogeneous-rank modules and more sophisticated LoRA derivatives. In this work, we introduce LoRA-Squeeze, a simple and efficient methodology that aims to improve standard LoRA learning by changing LoRA module ranks either post-hoc or dynamically during training}. Our approach posits that it is better to first learn an expressive, higher-rank solution and then compress it, rather than learning a constrained, low-rank solution directly. The method involves fine-tuning with a deliberately high(er) source rank, reconstructing or efficiently approximating the reconstruction of the full weight update matrix, and then using Randomized Singular Value Decomposition (RSVD) to create a new, compressed LoRA module at a lower target rank. Extensive experiments across 13 text and 10 vision-language tasks show that post-hoc compression often produces lower-rank adapters that outperform those trained directly at the target rank, especially if a small number of fine-tuning steps at the target rank is allowed. Moreover, a gradual, in-tuning rank annealing variant of LoRA-Squeeze consistently achieves the best LoRA size-performance trade-off."}

Although Large Language Models (LLMs) demonstrate strong capabilities in general sequential code generation, they face significant challenges in GPU code generation because of the scarcity of high-quality labeled training data, compiler biases when generating synthetic solutions, and limited generalization across hardware generations. This precludes supervised fine-tuning (SFT) as a scalable methodology for improving current LLMs. In contrast, reinforcement learning (RL) offers a data-efficient and adaptive alternative but requires access to relevant tools, careful selection of training problems, and a robust evaluation environment. We present Makora's environment and tools for reinforcement learning finetuning of frontier models and report our results from fine-tuning GPT-5 for Triton code generation. In the single-attempt setting, our fine-tuned model improves kernel correctness from 43.7% to 77.0% (+33.3 percentage points) and increases the fraction of problems outperforming TorchInductor from 14.8% to 21.8% (+7 percentage points) compared to baseline GPT-5, while exceeding prior state-of-the-art models on KernelBench. When integrated into a full coding agent, it is able to solve up to 97.4% of problems in an expanded KernelBench suite, outperforming the PyTorch TorchInductor compiler on 72.9% of problems with a geometric mean speedup of 2.12x.

However, achieving real-time DNN inference in the AV's perception pipeline is challenging due to the large gap between the computation requirement and the AV's limited resources. Most, if not all, of existing studies focus on optimizing the DNN inference time to achieve faster perception by compressing the DNN model with pruning and quantization. In contrast, we present a Predictable Perception system with DNNs (PP-DNN) that reduce the amount of image data to be processed while maintaining the same level of accuracy for multi-tenant DNNs by dynamically selecting critical frames and regions of interest (ROIs). PP-DNN is based on our key insight that critical frames and ROIs for AVs vary with the AV's surrounding environment. However, it is challenging to identify and use critical frames and ROIs in multi-tenant DNNs for predictable inference. Given image-frame streams, PP-DNN leverages an ROI generator to identify critical frames and ROIs based on the similarities of consecutive frames and traffic scenarios. PP-DNN then leverages a FLOPs predictor to predict multiply-accumulate operations (MACs) from the dynamic critical frames and ROIs. The ROI scheduler coordinates the processing of critical frames and ROIs with multiple DNN models. Finally, we design a detection predictor for the perception of non-critical frames. We have implemented PP-DNN in an ROS-based AV pipeline and evaluated it with the BDD100K and the nuScenes dataset. PP-DNN is observed to significantly enhance perception predictability, increasing the number of fusion frames by up to 7.3x, reducing the fusion delay by >2.6x and fusion-delay variations by >2.3x, improving detection completeness by 75.4% and the cost-effectiveness by up to 98% over the baseline."}

Second, it introduces a single-step sparse matrix factorization inspired by dictionary learning: using only a small calibration set, it sparsifies weight coefficients based on activation-weights sensitivity and then updates the dictionary in closed form via least squares bypassing iterative optimization, sparse coding, or backpropagation entirely. ROCKET consistently outperforms existing compression approaches across different model architectures at 20-50\\% compression rates.

We establish a progressive blocking strategy with monotonicity guarantees, enabling anytime risk estimation with valid lower bounds. We demonstrate that the classical Fellegi-Sunter linkage emerges as a special case of CVPL under restrictive assumptions, and that violations of these assumptions can lead to systematic over-linking bias. Empirical validation on 10,000 records across 19 protection configurations demonstrates that formal k-anonymity compliance may coexist with substantial empirical linkability, with a significant portion arising from non-quasi-identifier behavioral patterns.

On top of this architecture, we design 3D-FlashAttention, a fine-grained scheduling method that balances latency across tiers, forming a bubble-free vertical dataflow without on-chip SRAM roundtrips. Evaluations on Transformer workloads (OPT and QWEN models) show that our 3D spatial accelerator reduces 46-93% energy consumption and achieves 1.4x-7.6x speedups compared to state-of-the-art 2D and 3D designs."}

In many real-world domains, online learning in the environment can be risky, and specifying accurate safety costs can be difficult. However, it is often feasible to collect trajectories that reflect undesirable or unsafe behavior, implicitly conveying what the agent should avoid. We refer to these as non-preferred trajectories. We propose a novel offline safe IL algorithm, OSIL, that infers safety from non-preferred demonstrations. We formulate safe policy learning as a Constrained Markov Decision Process (CMDP). Instead of relying on explicit safety cost and reward annotations, OSIL reformulates the CMDP problem by deriving a lower bound on reward maximizing objective and learning a cost model that estimates the likelihood of non-preferred behavior. Our approach allows agents to learn safe and reward-maximizing behavior entirely from offline demonstrations. We empirically demonstrate that our approach can learn safer policies that satisfy cost constraints without degrading the reward performance, thus outperforming several baselines."}

Despite recent progress of large visual-language models and agentic AI, accurately counting such instruments remains highly challenging, particularly in dense scenarios where instruments are tightly clustered. To address this problem, we introduce Chain-of-Look, a novel visual reasoning framework that mimics the sequential human counting process by enforcing a structured visual chain, rather than relying on classic object detection which is unordered. This visual chain guides the model to count along a coherent spatial trajectory, improving accuracy in complex scenes. To further enforce the physical plausibility of the visual chain, we introduce the neighboring loss function, which explicitly models the spatial constraints inherent to densely packed surgical instruments. We also present SurgCount-HD, a new dataset comprising 1,464 high-density surgical instrument images. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method outperforms state-of-the-art approaches for counting (e.g., CountGD, REC) as well as Multimodality Large Language Models (e.g., Qwen, ChatGPT) in the challenging task of dense surgical instrument counting."}

Identifying linguistically interpretable markers of dementia can support transparent and clinically grounded screening approaches.\n  Methods: This study analyzes spontaneous speech transcripts from the DementiaBank Pitt Corpus using three linguistic representations: raw cleaned text, a part-of-speech (POS)-enhanced representation combining lexical and grammatical information, and a POS-only syntactic representation. Logistic regression and random forest models were evaluated under two protocols: transcript-level train-test splits and subject-level five-fold cross-validation to prevent speaker overlap. Model interpretability was examined using global feature importance, and statistical validation was conducted using Mann-Whitney U tests with Cliff's delta effect sizes.\n  Results: Across representations, models achieved stable performance, with syntactic and grammatical features retaining strong discriminative power even in the absence of lexical content. Subject-level evaluation yielded more conservative but consistent results, particularly for POS-enhanced and POS-only representations. Statistical analysis revealed significant group differences in functional word usage, lexical diversity, sentence structure, and discourse coherence, aligning closely with machine learning feature importance findings.\n  Conclusion: The results demonstrate that abstract linguistic features capture robust markers of early cognitive decline under clinically realistic evaluation. By combining interpretable machine learning with non-parametric statistical validation, this study supports the use of linguistically grounded features for transparent and reliable language-based cognitive screening."}

LLMs promise accessible natural language (NL) graph analytics, yet they fail to process industry-scale property graphs effectively and efficiently: such datasets are large, highly heterogeneous, structurally complex, and evolve dynamically. To address this, we devise a novel abstraction for complex multi-query analytics over such graphs. Its key idea is to replace brittle generation of graph queries directly from NL with planning over a Semantic Catalog that describes both the graph schema and the graph operations. Concretely, this induces a clean separation between a Semantic Plane for LLM planning and broader reasoning, and an Execution Plane for deterministic, database-grade query execution over the full dataset and tool implementations. This design yields substantial gains in both token efficiency and task effectiveness even with small-context LLMs. We use this abstraction as the basis of the first LLM-enhanced graph analytics framework called GraphSeek. GraphSeek achieves substantially higher success rates (e.g., 86% over enhanced LangChain) and points toward the next generation of affordable and accessible graph analytics that unify LLM reasoning with database-grade execution over large and complex property graphs."}

Our approach formalizes the intent-to-action pathway with a hierarchical labeling scheme, predicting high-level communicative intents and low-level speech acts to learn their causal and temporal dependencies. To train this system, we develop a high quality corpus that pairs controllable, event-rich dialogue data with human-annotated labels. The GoT framework structures streaming predictions as an evolving graph, enabling a transformer to forecast the next speech act, generate concise justifications for its decisions, and dynamically refine its reasoning. Experiments on both synthetic and real duplex dialogues show that the framework delivers robust behavior detection, produces interpretable reasoning chains, and establishes a foundation for benchmarking conversational reasoning in full duplex spoken dialogue systems."}

To address these challenges, we propose ''chatting with images'', a new framework that reframes visual manipulation as language-guided feature modulation. Under the guidance of expressive language prompts, the model dynamically performs joint re-encoding over multiple image regions, enabling tighter coupling between linguistic reasoning and visual state updates. We instantiate this paradigm in ViLaVT, a novel LVLM equipped with a dynamic vision encoder explicitly designed for such interactive visual reasoning, and trained it with a two-stage curriculum combining supervised fine-tuning and reinforcement learning to promote effective reasoning behaviors. Extensive experiments across eight benchmarks demonstrate that ViLaVT achieves strong and consistent improvements, with particularly pronounced gains on complex multi-image and video-based spatial reasoning tasks."}

In this work, we study pretraining from the perspective of model plasticity, that is, the ability of the base model to successfully adapt to downstream tasks through fine-tuning. We focus on the role of weight decay, a key regularization parameter during pretraining. Through systematic experiments, we show that models trained with larger weight decay values are more plastic, meaning they show larger performance gains when fine-tuned on downstream tasks. This phenomenon can lead to counterintuitive trade-offs where base models that perform worse after pretraining can perform better after fine-tuning. Further investigation of weight decay's mechanistic effects on model behavior reveals that it encourages linearly separable representations, regularizes attention matrices, and reduces overfitting on the training data.

Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have emerged as the primary reward provider, leveraging their rich multimodal priors to guide alignment. However, their computation and memory cost can be substantial, and optimizing a latent diffusion generator through a pixel-space reward introduces a domain mismatch that complicates alignment. In this paper, we propose DiNa-LRM, a diffusion-native latent reward model that formulates preference learning directly on noisy diffusion states. Our method introduces a noise-calibrated Thurstone likelihood with diffusion-noise-dependent uncertainty. DiNa-LRM leverages a pretrained latent diffusion backbone with a timestep-conditioned reward head, and supports inference-time noise ensembling, providing a diffusion-native mechanism for test-time scaling and robust rewarding. Across image alignment benchmarks, DiNa-LRM substantially outperforms existing diffusion-based reward baselines and achieves performance competitive with state-of-the-art VLMs at a fraction of the computational cost. In preference optimization, we demonstrate that DiNa-LRM improves preference optimization dynamics, enabling faster and more resource-efficient model alignment."}
