While diffusion models have shown remarkable generative capability\nacross various domains, we employ the powerful architecture to perform\nneuro-symbolic learning and solve logical puzzles. Our diffusion-based pipeline\nadopts a two-stage training strategy: the first stage focuses on cultivating\nbasic reasoning abilities, while the second emphasizes systematic learning of\nlogical constraints. To impose hard constraints on neural outputs in the second\nstage, we formulate the diffusion reasoner as a Markov decision process and\ninnovatively fine-tune it with an improved proximal policy optimization\nalgorithm. We utilize a rule-based reward signal derived from the logical\nconsistency of neural outputs and adopt a flexible strategy to optimize the\ndiffusion reasoner's policy. We evaluate our methodology on some classical\nsymbolic reasoning benchmarks, including Sudoku, Maze, pathfinding and\npreference learning. Experimental results demonstrate that our approach\nachieves outstanding accuracy and logical consistency among neural networks."}

The goal\nof prompt compression is to shorten the LLM prompt while maintaining a high\ngeneration quality. However, existing solutions, mainly based on token removal,\nface challenges such as information loss and structural incoherence, like\nmissing grammar elements in a sentence, or incomplete word phrases after token\nremoval. Such challenges limit the final generation quality of LLM.\n  To overcome these limitations, we present a novel generative prompt\ncompression method. Unlike the existing token removal methods, our method\ncenters at a chunking-and-summarization mechanism. Specifically, our method\nsplits prompt into semantically coherent chunks and rewrites the chunks to be\nmore concise. The chunks are reconstructed into meaningful prompt finally. We\ndesign several optimization techniques for the mechanism, including optimized\nsemantic chunking, outlier chunk handling, dynamic compression ratio,\ncompression prioritization, and keyword maintaining. These techniques\neffectively improve the identifying and preserving of critical information and\ncoherence among texts, as well as providing finer grind control of the\ncompression ratio. We conduct extensive evaluation on question-answering and\nsummarization tasks, with datasets covering multiple different domain.

While\nrecent advances in LLMs and MLLMs have shown that incorporating explicit\nreasoning significantly improves understanding and generalization, reasoning in\nLSMs remains in a nascent stage. Early efforts attempt to transfer the\n\"Thinking-before-Speaking\" paradigm from textual models to speech.

To address this, we propose Mini-Omni-Reasoner, a\nframework that enables reasoning within speech via a novel\n\"Thinking-in-Speaking\" formulation. Rather than completing reasoning before\nproducing any verbal output, Mini-Omni-Reasoner interleaves silent reasoning\ntokens with spoken response tokens at the token level. This design allows\ncontinuous speech generation while embedding structured internal reasoning,\nleveraging the model's high-frequency token processing capability. Although\ninterleaved, local semantic alignment is enforced to ensure that each response\ntoken is informed by its preceding reasoning. To support this framework, we\nintroduce Spoken-Math-Problems-3M, a large-scale dataset tailored for\ninterleaved reasoning and response. The dataset ensures that verbal tokens\nconsistently follow relevant reasoning content, enabling accurate and efficient\nlearning of speech-coupled reasoning. Built on a hierarchical Thinker-Talker\narchitecture, Mini-Omni-Reasoner delivers fluent yet logically grounded spoken\nresponses, maintaining both naturalness and precision.

To quantify this effect, we introduce a novel metric and demonstrate\nthat collapse errors occur across a variety of settings.

To achieve this, we propose\ncross-modal relation graphs that reconstruct monomodal features to acquire\nmultimodal representations. The features are reconstructed based on the node\nneighborhood, where the neighborhood is decided by the features of a different\nmodality. We also propose Hierarchical Interactive Monomadal Attention (HIMA)\nto focus on pertinent information within a modality. While cross-modal relation\ngraphs help comprehend high-order relationships between two modalities, HIMA\nhelps in multitasking by learning discriminative features of individual\nmodalities before late-fusing them. Finally, extensive experimental evaluation\non three datasets demonstrates that the proposed approach effectively\ncomprehends multimodal content for multiple tasks."}

Existing systems for detecting abusive content or issuing safety alerts\noperate in isolation and rarely combine digital safety with emotional\nwell-being.

The system employs Firebase for\nalert management and a modular architecture designed for usability, privacy,\nand scalability. The experimental evaluation shows 93% precision in toxicity\ndetection, 100% reliability in safety alerts under emulator tests, and 92%\nalignment between automated and manual questionnaire scoring.

In domains where new data can be simulated cheaply,\nthese systems uncover sequential decision-making policies that far exceed the\nability of any human. Society faces many problems whose solutions require this\nskill, but they are often in domains where new data cannot be cheaply\nsimulated. In such scenarios, we can learn simulators from existing data, but\nthese will only ever be approximately correct, and can be pathologically\nincorrect when queried outside of their training distribution. As a result, a\nmisalignment between the environments in which we train our agents and the\nreal-world in which we wish to deploy our agents is inevitable. Dealing with\nthis misalignment is the primary concern of zero-shot reinforcement learning, a\nproblem setting where the agent must generalise to a new task or domain with\nzero practice shots. Whilst impressive progress has been made on methods that\nperform zero-shot RL in idealised settings, new work is needed if these results\nare to be replicated in real-world settings. In this thesis, we argue that\ndoing so requires us to navigate (at least) three constraints. First, the data\nquality constraint: real-world datasets are small and homogeneous. Second, the\nobservability constraint: states, dynamics and rewards in the real-world are\noften only partially observed. And third, the data availability constraint: a\npriori access to data cannot always be assumed. This work proposes a suite of\nmethods that perform zero-shot RL subject to these constraints. In a series of\nempirical studies we expose the failings of existing methods, and justify our\ntechniques for remedying them. We believe these designs take us a step closer\nto RL methods that can be deployed to solve real-world problems."}

(3) Low-rank and\nshallow recovery is effective: restoring singular vector directions for the top\n20% of values or first 25% of layers recovers 70-80% of OOD performance.

To achieve efficient Real-ISR, many works\nemploy Variational Score Distillation (VSD) to distill pre-trained\nstable-diffusion (SD) model for one-step SR with a fixed timestep. However, due\nto the different noise injection timesteps, the SD will perform different\ngenerative priors. Therefore, a fixed timestep is difficult for these methods\nto fully leverage the generative priors in SD, leading to suboptimal\nperformance. To address this, we propose a Time-Aware one-step Diffusion\nNetwork for Real-ISR (TADSR). We first introduce a Time-Aware VAE Encoder,\nwhich projects the same image into different latent features based on\ntimesteps. Through joint dynamic variation of timesteps and latent features,\nthe student model can better align with the input pattern distribution of the\npre-trained SD, thereby enabling more effective utilization of SD's generative\ncapabilities. To better activate the generative prior of SD at different\ntimesteps, we propose a Time-Aware VSD loss that bridges the timesteps of the\nstudent model and those of the teacher model, thereby producing more consistent\ngenerative prior guidance conditioned on timesteps. Additionally, though\nutilizing the generative prior in SD at different timesteps, our method can\nnaturally achieve controllable trade-offs between fidelity and realism by\nchanging the timestep condition.
