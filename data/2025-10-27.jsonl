Convolutional neural\nnetworks significantly impact image segmentation; however, since convolution\noperations are local, capturing global contextual information and long-range\ndependencies is still challenging. Their capacity to precisely segment\nstructures with complicated borders and a variety of sizes is impacted by this\nrestriction. Since transformers use self-attention methods to capture global\ncontext and long-range dependencies efficiently, integrating transformer-based\narchitecture with CNNs is a feasible approach to overcoming these challenges.\nTo address these challenges, we propose the Focal Modulation and Bidirectional\nFeature Fusion Network for Medical Image Segmentation, referred to as\nFM-BFF-Net in the remainder of this paper. The network combines convolutional\nand transformer components, employs a focal modulation attention mechanism to\nrefine context awareness, and introduces a bidirectional feature fusion module\nthat enables efficient interaction between encoder and decoder representations\nacross scales.

These components are\nunified under a multi-loss objective, where the Gompertz curve modulates the\ninfluence of distillation losses over time. Extensive experiments on CIFAR-10\nand CIFAR-100 using various teacher-student architectures (e.g., ResNet50 and\nMobileNet_v2) demonstrate that Gompertz-CNN consistently outperforms\ntraditional distillation methods, achieving up to 8% and 4% accuracy gains on\nCIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100, respectively."}

However, purely IMU-based\ntracking compromises translation estimates and accurate relative positioning\nbetween individuals, as inertial cues are inherently self-referential and\nprovide no direct spatial reference for others. In this paper, we present a\nnovel approach for robustly estimating body poses and global translation for\nmultiple individuals by leveraging the distances between sparse wearable\nsensors - both on each individual and across multiple individuals. Our method\nGroup Inertial Poser estimates these absolute distances between pairs of\nsensors from ultra-wideband ranging (UWB) and fuses them with inertial\nobservations as input into structured state-space models to integrate temporal\nmotion patterns for precise 3D pose estimation. Our novel two-step optimization\nfurther leverages the estimated distances for accurately tracking people's\nglobal trajectories through the world. We also introduce GIP-DB, the first\nIMU+UWB dataset for two-person tracking, which comprises 200 minutes of motion\nrecordings from 14 participants. In our evaluation, Group Inertial Poser\noutperforms previous state-of-the-art methods in accuracy and robustness across\nsynthetic and real-world data, showing the promise of IMU+UWB-based multi-human\nmotion capture in the wild.

We seek to address this challenge by\napplying post-hoc explanations to provide evidence for predictions and document\nlimitations that are important to field deployment. Using aerial imagery from\nGlacier Bay National Park, we train a Faster R-CNN to detect pinnipeds (harbor\nseals) and generate explanations via gradient-based class activation mapping\n(HiResCAM, LayerCAM), local interpretable model-agnostic explanations (LIME),\nand perturbation-based explanations. We assess explanations along three axes\nrelevant to field use: (i) localization fidelity: whether high-attribution\nregions coincide with the animal rather than background context; (ii)\nfaithfulness: whether deletion/insertion tests produce changes in detector\nconfidence; and (iii) diagnostic utility: whether explanations reveal\nsystematic failure modes. Explanations concentrate on seal torsos and contours\nrather than surrounding ice/rock, and removal of the seals reduces detection\nconfidence, providing model-evidence for true positives. The analysis also\nuncovers recurrent error sources, including confusion between seals and black\nice and rocks. We translate these findings into actionable next steps for model\ndevelopment, including more targeted data curation and augmentation. By pairing\nobject detection with post-hoc explainability, we can move beyond \"black-box\"\npredictions toward auditable, decision-supporting tools for conservation\nmonitoring."}
