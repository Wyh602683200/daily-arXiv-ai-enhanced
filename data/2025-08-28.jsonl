While quantized LLMs often maintain performance on\nperplexity and zero-shot tasks, their impact on truthfulness-whether generating\ntruthful or deceptive responses-remains largely unexplored. In this work, we\nintroduce TruthfulnessEval, a comprehensive evaluation framework for assessing\nthe truthfulness of quantized LLMs across three dimensions: (1) Truthfulness on\nLogical Reasoning; (2) Truthfulness on Common Sense; and (3) Truthfulness on\nImitative Falsehoods. Using this framework, we examine mainstream quantization\ntechniques (ranging from 4-bit to extreme 2-bit) across several open-source\nLLMs. Surprisingly, we find that while quantized models retain internally\ntruthful representations, they are more susceptible to producing false outputs\nunder misleading prompts. To probe this vulnerability, we test 15 rephrased\nvariants of \"honest\", \"neutral\" and \"deceptive\" prompts and observe that\n\"deceptive\" prompts can override truth-consistent behavior, whereas \"honest\"\nand \"neutral\" prompts maintain stable outputs.

We\nrun MRT on existing LLM monitor scaffoldings, which orchestrate LLMs and parse\nagent trajectories, alongside a new hybrid hierarchical-sequential scaffolding\nproposed in this work. Our empirical results yield three key findings. First,\nagent awareness dominates monitor awareness: an agent's knowledge that it is\nbeing monitored substantially degrades the monitor's reliability. On the\ncontrary, providing the monitor with more information about the agent is less\nhelpful than expected. Second, monitor scaffolding matters more than monitor\nawareness: the hybrid scaffolding consistently outperforms baseline monitor\nscaffolding, and can enable weaker models to reliably monitor stronger agents\n-- a weak-to-strong scaling effect. Third, in a human-in-the-loop setting where\nhumans discuss with the LLM monitor to get an updated judgment for the agent's\nbehavior, targeted human oversight is most effective; escalating only\npre-flagged cases to human reviewers improved the TPR by approximately 15% at\nFPR = 0.01.

To tackle these problems, this paper introduces ReST-RL, a\nunified LLM RL paradigm that significantly improves LLM's code reasoning\nability by combining an improved GRPO algorithm with a meticulously designed\ntest time decoding method assisted by a value model (VM). As the first stage of\npolicy reinforcement, ReST-GRPO adopts an optimized ReST algorithm to filter\nand assemble high-value training data, increasing the reward variance of GRPO\nsampling, thus improving the effectiveness and efficiency of training. After\nthe basic reasoning ability of LLM policy has been improved, we further propose\na test time decoding optimization method called VM-MCTS. Through Monte-Carlo\nTree Search (MCTS), we collect accurate value targets with no annotation\nrequired, on which VM training is based. When decoding, the VM is deployed by\nan adapted MCTS algorithm to provide precise process signals as well as\nverification scores, assisting the LLM policy to achieve high reasoning\naccuracy.

However, building such a practical\nsystem that can interact with diverse input signals in real time remains\nchallenging to existing methods, which often struggle with high latency, heavy\ncomputational cost, and limited controllability. In this work, we introduce an\nautoregressive video generation framework that enables interactive multimodal\ncontrol and low-latency extrapolation in a streaming manner. With minimal\nmodifications to a standard large language model (LLM), our framework accepts\nmultimodal condition encodings including audio, pose, and text, and outputs\nspatially and semantically coherent representations to guide the denoising\nprocess of a diffusion head. To support this, we construct a large-scale\ndialogue dataset of approximately 20,000 hours from multiple sources, providing\nrich conversational scenarios for training. We further introduce a deep\ncompression autoencoder with up to 64$\\times$ reduction ratio, which\neffectively alleviates the long-horizon inference burden of the autoregressive\nmodel. Extensive experiments on duplex conversation, multilingual human\nsynthesis, and interactive world model highlight the advantages of our approach\nin low latency, high efficiency, and fine-grained multimodal controllability."}

However, the generated images often\ncontain structural or semantic defects due to training imperfections. Training\nsegmentation models with such flawed data can lead to performance degradation\nand error accumulation. To address this issue, we propose to integrate inverse\nevolution layers (IELs) into the generative process.

Therefore, in this paper, we intervene on\nnoise injection and establish a layer-specific functional demarcation within\nthe LLM: shallow layers specialize in local context modeling, intermediate\nlayers focus on integrating long-range external factual knowledge, and deeper\nlayers primarily rely on parametric internal knowledge.

Therefore, we present CoPLOT, a novel Collaborative perception\nframework that utilizes Point-Level Optimized Tokens. It incorporates a\npoint-native processing pipeline, including token reordering, sequence\nmodeling, and multi-agent spatial alignment. A semantic-aware token reordering\nmodule generates adaptive 1D reorderings by leveraging scene-level and\ntoken-level semantic information. A frequency-enhanced state space model\ncaptures long-range sequence dependencies across both spatial and spectral\ndomains, improving the differentiation between foreground tokens and background\nclutter. Lastly, a neighbor-to-ego alignment module applies a closed-loop\nprocess, combining global agent-level correction with local token-level\nrefinement to mitigate localization noise. Extensive experiments on both\nsimulated and real-world datasets show that CoPLOT outperforms state-of-the-art\nmodels, with even lower communication and computation overhead.

We demonstrate\nthat the rate of conditional entropy production during generation (i.e. the\ngenerative bandwidth) is directly governed by the expected divergence of the\nscore function's vector field. This divergence, in turn, is linked to the\nbranching of trajectories and generative bifurcations, which we characterize as\nsymmetry-breaking phase transitions in the energy landscape. This synthesis\noffers a powerful insight: the process of generation is fundamentally driven by\nthe controlled, noise-induced breaking of (approximate) symmetries, where peaks\nin information transfer correspond to critical transitions between possible\noutcomes. The score function acts as a dynamic non-linear filter that regulates\nthe bandwidth of the noise by suppressing fluctuations that are incompatible\nwith the data."}

However, their inference remains slower than that of\nautoregressive models, primarily due to the cost of bidirectional attention and\nthe large number of refinement steps required for high quality outputs. In this\nwork, we highlight and leverage an overlooked property of DLMs early answer\nconvergence: in many cases, the correct answer can be internally identified by\nhalf steps before the final decoding step, both under semi-autoregressive and\nrandom remasking schedules. For example, on GSM8K and MMLU, up to 97% and 99%\nof instances, respectively, can be decoded correctly using only half of the\nrefinement steps. Building on this observation, we introduce Prophet, a\ntraining-free fast decoding paradigm that enables early commit decoding.\nSpecifically, Prophet dynamically decides whether to continue refinement or to\ngo \"all-in\" (i.e., decode all remaining tokens in one step), using the\nconfidence gap between the top-2 prediction candidates as the criterion. It\nintegrates seamlessly into existing DLM implementations, incurs negligible\noverhead, and requires no additional training. Empirical evaluations of\nLLaDA-8B and Dream-7B across multiple tasks show that Prophet reduces the\nnumber of decoding steps by up to 3.4x while preserving high generation\nquality. These results recast DLM decoding as a problem of when to stop\nsampling, and demonstrate that early decode convergence provides a simple yet\npowerful mechanism for accelerating DLM inference, complementary to existing\nspeedup techniques.
