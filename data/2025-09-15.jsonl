Methods: Drafting times for IND nonclinical written\nsummaries (eCTD modules 2.6.2, 2.6.4, 2.6.6) generated by AutoIND were directly\nrecorded. For comparison, manual drafting times for IND summaries previously\ncleared by the U.S. FDA were estimated from the experience of regulatory\nwriters ($\\geq$6 years) and used as industry-standard benchmarks. Quality was\nassessed by a blinded regulatory writing assessor using seven pre-specified\ncategories: correctness, completeness, conciseness, consistency, clarity,\nredundancy, and emphasis. Each sub-criterion was scored 0-3 and normalized to a\npercentage. A critical regulatory error was defined as any misrepresentation or\nomission likely to alter regulatory interpretation (e.g., incorrect NOAEL,\nomission of mandatory GLP dose-formulation analysis). Results: AutoIND reduced\ninitial drafting time by $\\sim$97% (from $\\sim$100 h to 3.7 h for 18,870\npages/61 reports in IND-1; and to 2.6 h for 11,425 pages/58 reports in IND-2).\nQuality scores were 69.6\\% and 77.9\\% for IND-1 and IND-2. No critical\nregulatory errors were detected, but deficiencies in emphasis, conciseness, and\nclarity were noted. Conclusions: AutoIND can dramatically accelerate IND\ndrafting, but expert regulatory writers remain essential to mature outputs to\nsubmission-ready quality. Systematic deficiencies identified provide a roadmap\nfor targeted model improvements."}

Existing approaches often rely on heuristics or fixed weights, which\nfail to generalize across varying measurement conditions and irregular timestep\nschedules. In this work, we propose Zero-shot Adaptive Diffusion Sampling\n(ZADS), a test-time optimization method that adaptively tunes fidelity weights\nacross arbitrary noise schedules without requiring retraining of the diffusion\nprior. ZADS treats the denoising process as a fixed unrolled sampler and\noptimizes fidelity weights in a self-supervised manner using only undersampled\nmeasurements.

Although exploration reduces human effort, it lacks safety\nguarantees and often results in frequent collisions -- particularly in\nclearance-limited tasks (e.g., peg-in-hole) -- thereby, necessitating manual\nenvironmental resets and imposing additional human burden. This study proposes\nSelf-Augmented Robot Trajectory (SART), a framework that enables policy\nlearning from a single human demonstration, while safely expanding the dataset\nthrough autonomous augmentation. SART consists of two stages: (1) human\nteaching only once, where a single demonstration is provided and precision\nboundaries -- represented as spheres around key waypoints -- are annotated,\nfollowed by one environment reset; (2) robot self-augmentation, where the robot\ngenerates diverse, collision-free trajectories within these boundaries and\nreconnects to the original demonstration. This design improves the data\ncollection efficiency by minimizing human effort while ensuring safety.\nExtensive evaluations in simulation and real-world manipulation tasks show that\nSART achieves substantially higher success rates than policies trained solely\non human-collected demonstrations.

The parasite's largely underground life cycle makes early\ndetection difficult, while conventional chemical controls are costly,\nenvironmentally harmful, and often ineffective. To address this, we combined\ndrone-based multispectral imagery with Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) deep\nlearning networks, using the Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique (SMOTE)\nto handle class imbalance. Research was conducted on a known broomrape-infested\ntomato farm in Woodland, Yolo County, CA, across five key growth stages\ndetermined by growing degree days (GDD). Multispectral images were processed to\nisolate tomato canopy reflectance. At 897 GDD, broomrape could be detected with\n79.09 percent overall accuracy and 70.36 percent recall without integrating\nlater stages. Incorporating sequential growth stages with LSTM improved\ndetection substantially. The best-performing scenario, which integrated all\ngrowth stages with SMOTE augmentation, achieved 88.37 percent overall accuracy\nand 95.37 percent recall.

The rise of Large Language Models (LLMs) has led to their widespread\nadoption in development pipelines. Goal. We empirically assess the energy\nefficiency of Python code generated by LLMs against human-written code and code\ndeveloped by a Green software expert. Method. We test 363 solutions to 9 coding\nproblems from the EvoEval benchmark using 6 widespread LLMs with 4 prompting\ntechniques, and comparing them to human-developed solutions. Energy consumption\nis measured on three different hardware platforms: a server, a PC, and a\nRaspberry Pi for a total of ~881h (36.7 days). Results. Human solutions are 16%\nmore energy-efficient on the server and 3% on the Raspberry Pi, while LLMs\noutperform human developers by 25% on the PC.

The proposed\nmethod employs an adapter network that injects fused multimodal features into\nSAM's rich RGB features. This design enables the model to retain the strong\ngeneralization ability of RGB features while selectively incorporating\nauxiliary modalities only when they contribute additional cues. As a result, MM\nSAM-adapter achieves a balanced and efficient use of multimodal information. We\nevaluate our approach on three challenging benchmarks, DeLiVER, FMB, and MUSES,\nwhere MM SAM-adapter delivers state-of-the-art performance. To further analyze\nmodality contributions, we partition DeLiVER and FMB into RGB-easy and RGB-hard\nsubsets. Results consistently demonstrate that our framework outperforms\ncompeting methods in both favorable and adverse conditions, highlighting the\neffectiveness of multimodal adaptation for robust scene understanding.

This has led to\nclaims about these model's ability to solve (learn) unseen tasks with only a\nfew shots (exemplars) in the prompt. However, deduction does not always imply\nlearning, as ICL does not explicitly encode a given observation. Instead, the\nmodels rely on their prior knowledge and the exemplars given, if any. We argue\nthat, mathematically, ICL does constitute learning, but its full\ncharacterisation requires empirical work. We then carry out a large-scale\nanalysis of ICL ablating out or accounting for memorisation, pretraining,\ndistributional shifts, and prompting style and phrasing. We find that ICL is an\neffective learning paradigm, but limited in its ability to learn and generalise\nto unseen tasks. We note that, in the limit where exemplars become more\nnumerous, accuracy is insensitive to exemplar distribution, model, prompt\nstyle, and the input's linguistic features. Instead, it deduces patterns from\nregularities in the prompt, which leads to distributional sensitivity,\nespecially in prompting styles such as chain-of-thought. Given the varied\naccuracies on formally similar tasks, we conclude that autoregression's ad-hoc\nencoding is not a robust mechanism, and suggests limited all-purpose\ngeneralisability."}

The Bridge2AI consortium\nhas defined the particular criteria a biomedical dataset may possess to render\nit AI-ready: in brief, a dataset's readiness is related to its FAIRness,\nprovenance, degree of characterization, explainability, sustainability, and\ncomputability, in addition to its accompaniment with documentation about\nethical data practices.\n  To ensure AI-readiness and to clarify data structure and relationships within\nBridge2AI's Grand Challenges (GCs), particular types of metadata are necessary.\nThe GCs within the Bridge2AI initiative include four data-generating projects\nfocusing on generating AI/ML-ready datasets to tackle complex biomedical and\nbehavioral research problems. These projects develop standardized, multimodal\ndata, tools, and training resources to support AI integration, while addressing\nethical data practices. Examples include using voice as a biomarker, building\ninterpretable genomic tools, modeling disease trajectories with diverse\nmultimodal data, and mapping cellular and molecular health indicators across\nthe human body.\n  This report assesses the state of metadata creation and standardization in\nthe Bridge2AI GCs, provides guidelines where required, and identifies gaps and\nareas for improvement across the program.
