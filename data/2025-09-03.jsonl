While performance on\nbenchmark datasets continues to improve, clinical adoption requires more than\naccuracy: models must be controllable and explainable. In this paper, we\npresent a systematic comparative analysis of four representative\napproaches--YOLO-Stutter, FluentNet, UDM, and SSDM--along three dimensions:\nperformance, controllability, and explainability. Through comprehensive\nevaluation on multiple datasets and expert clinician assessment, we find that\nYOLO-Stutter and FluentNet provide efficiency and simplicity, but with limited\ntransparency; UDM achieves the best balance of accuracy and clinical\ninterpretability; and SSDM, while promising, could not be fully reproduced in\nour experiments. Our analysis highlights the trade-offs among competing\napproaches and identifies future directions for clinically viable dysfluency\nmodeling.

Recently, driven by the rise of large language models (LLMs), research\nhas increasingly shifted from purely time series methods toward harnessing\ntextual modalities to enhance forecasting performance. However, the vast\ndiscrepancy between text and temporal data often leads current multimodal\narchitectures to over-emphasise one modality while neglecting the other,\nresulting in information loss that harms forecasting performance. To address\nthis modality imbalance, we introduce BALM-TSF (Balanced Multimodal Alignment\nfor LLM-Based Time Series Forecasting), a lightweight time series forecasting\nframework that maintains balance between the two modalities. Specifically, raw\ntime series are processed by the time series encoder, while descriptive\nstatistics of raw time series are fed to an LLM with learnable prompt,\nproducing compact textual embeddings. To ensure balanced cross-modal context\nalignment of time series and textual embeddings, a simple yet effective scaling\nstrategy combined with a contrastive objective then maps these textual\nembeddings into the latent space of the time series embeddings. Finally, the\naligned textual semantic embeddings and time series embeddings are together\nintegrated for forecasting. Extensive experiments on standard benchmarks show\nthat, with minimal trainable parameters, BALM-TSF achieves state-of-the-art\nperformance in both long-term and few-shot forecasting, confirming its ability\nto harness complementary information from text and time series.

Similar to the bimodal setting, the priors from the text\nmodality tend to dominate, leading OLLMs to rely more heavily on textual cues\nwhile neglecting visual and audio information. In addition, fully multimodal\nscenarios introduce new challenges. Most existing models align visual or\nauditory modalities with text independently during training, while ignoring the\nintrinsic correlations between video and its corresponding audio. This\noversight results in hallucinations when reasoning requires interpreting hidden\naudio cues embedded in video content. To address these challenges, we propose\nOmniDPO, a preference-alignment framework designed to mitigate hallucinations\nin OLLMs. Specifically, OmniDPO incorporates two strategies: (1) constructing\ntext-preference sample pairs to enhance the model's understanding of\naudio-video interactions; and (2) constructing multimodal-preference sample\npairs to strengthen the model's attention to visual and auditory information.\nBy tackling both challenges, OmniDPO effectively improves multimodal grounding\nand reduces hallucination.

One is\nthat dynamic programming does not work for fractional objectives, and the other\nis that dynamic programming is invalid for risk metrics. In this paper, we\nstudy the Sharpe ratio optimization in infinite-horizon MDPs, considering both\nthe long-run average and discounted settings. We address the first challenge\nwith the Dinkelbachs transform, which converts the Sharpe ratio objective to a\nmean-squared-variance (M2V) objective.

For the\nsecond challenge, we develop an iterative algorithm to solve the M2V\noptimization which is similar to a mean-variance optimization in MDPs.

To automatically\nconstruct DeepResearch Arena, we propose a Multi-Agent Hierarchical Task\nGeneration (MAHTG) system that extracts research-worthy inspirations from\nseminar transcripts. The MAHTG system further translates research-worthy\ninspirations into high-quality research tasks, ensuring the traceability of\nresearch task formulation while filtering noise. With the MAHTG system, we\ncurate DeepResearch Arena with over 10,000 high-quality research tasks from\nover 200 academic seminars, spanning 12 disciplines, such as literature,\nhistory, and science. Our extensive evaluation shows that DeepResearch Arena\npresents substantial challenges for current state-of-the-art agents, with clear\nperformance gaps observed across different models."}

While\nLarge Language Models (LLMs) can generate code for search heuristics, their\napplication has largely been confined to adjusting simple functions within\nhuman-crafted frameworks, leaving their capacity for broader innovation an open\nquestion. To investigate this, we tasked an LLM with building a complete solver\nfor the constrained 3D Packing Problem. Direct code generation quickly proved\nfragile, prompting us to introduce two supports: constraint\nscaffolding--prewritten constraint-checking code--and iterative\nself-correction--additional refinement cycles to repair bugs and produce a\nviable initial population. Notably, even within a vast search space in a greedy\nprocess, the LLM concentrated its efforts almost exclusively on refining the\nscoring function. This suggests that the emphasis on scoring functions in prior\nwork may reflect not a principled strategy, but rather a natural limitation of\nLLM capabilities. The resulting heuristic was comparable to a human-designed\ngreedy algorithm, and when its scoring function was integrated into a\nhuman-crafted metaheuristic, its performance rivaled established solvers,\nthough its effectiveness waned as constraints tightened. Our findings highlight\ntwo major barriers to automated heuristic design with current LLMs: the\nengineering required to mitigate their fragility in complex reasoning tasks,\nand the influence of pretrained biases, which can prematurely narrow the search\nfor novel solutions."}

We also conduct a comprehensive evaluation across 28 multimodal\nreward models spanning three categories: generative, discriminative, and\nsemi-scalar. Results show that even the top-performing model GPT-4o achieves\nonly 57.0% overall accuracy, and the state-of-the-art open-source model\nQwen2.5-VL-72B reaches merely 53.3%.

Therefore, existing methods often inadequately resolve both the\ndynamic coherence and the complex semantic context of the perceived visual\nstimuli. To overcome these limitations, we introduce DynaMind, a novel\nframework that reconstructs video by jointly modeling neural dynamics and\nsemantic features via three core modules: a Regional-aware Semantic Mapper\n(RSM), a Temporal-aware Dynamic Aligner (TDA), and a Dual-Guidance Video\nReconstructor (DGVR). The RSM first utilizes a regional-aware encoder to\nextract multimodal semantic features from EEG signals across distinct brain\nregions, aggregating them into a unified diffusion prior. In the mean time, the\nTDA generates a dynamic latent sequence, or blueprint, to enforce temporal\nconsistency between the feature representations and the original neural\nrecordings. Together, guided by the semantic diffusion prior, the DGVR\ntranslates the temporal-aware blueprint into a high-fidelity video\nreconstruction. On the SEED-DV dataset, DynaMind sets a new state-of-the-art\n(SOTA), boosting reconstructed video accuracies (video- and frame-based) by\n12.5 and 10.3 percentage points, respectively.

We release a reference implementation\nof MeVe as a proof of concept and evaluate its performance on knowledge-heavy\nQA tasks over a subset of English Wikipedia [22]. Our results demonstrate that\nby actively verifying information before composition, MeVe significantly\nimproves context efficiency, achieving a 57% reduction on the Wikipedia dataset\nand a 75% reduction on the more complex HotpotQA dataset compared to standard\nRAG implementations [25]. This work provides a framework for more scalable and\nreliable LLM applications. By refining and distilling contextual information,\nMeVe offers a path toward better grounding and more accurate factual support\n[16]."}

As a result, these agents do not improve with more\nexperience. In this paper, we show that agents backed by weaker models that\nimprove via reinforcement learning (RL) can outperform agents backed by much\nlarger, but static models. We identify two major challenges with RL in this\nsetting. First, actions can take a variable amount of time (e.g., executing\ncode for different solutions), which leads to asynchronous policy gradient\nupdates that favor faster but suboptimal solutions. To tackle variable-duration\nactions, we propose duration- aware gradient updates in a distributed\nasynchronous RL framework to amplify high-cost but high-reward actions. Second,\nusing only test split performance as a reward provides limited feedback. A\nprogram that is nearly correct is treated the same as one that fails entirely.\nTo address this, we propose environment instrumentation to offer partial\ncredit, distinguishing almost-correct programs from those that fail early\n(e.g., during data loading). Environment instrumentation uses a separate static\nlanguage model to insert print statement to an existing program to log the\nagent's experimental progress, from which partial credit can be extracted as\nreward signals for learning. Our experimental results on MLEBench suggest that\nperforming gradient updates on a much smaller model (Qwen2.5-3B) trained with\nRL outperforms prompting a much larger model (Claude-3.5-Sonnet) with agent\nscaffolds, by an average of 22% across 12 Kaggle tasks."}

To answer this\nquestion, we systematically evaluate 7 LLMs (e.g., GPT and Gemini family)\nacross 6 benchmarks, including both multiple-choice and open-ended tasks on 12\ndiverse prompt templates. We find that much of the prompt sensitivity stems\nfrom heuristic evaluation methods, including log-likelihood scoring and rigid\nanswer matching, which often overlook semantically correct responses expressed\nthrough alternative phrasings, such as synonyms or paraphrases.

In this paper, we present Contrastive Reasoning Prompt\nOptimization (CRPO), a novel framework that formulates prompt optimization as a\nretrieval augmented reasoning process. Our approach retrieves top k reference\nprompts from the HelpSteer2 dataset, an open-source collection annotated for\nhelpfulness, correctness, coherence, complexity, and verbosity, and constructs\ntwo complementary optimization paradigms: (1) tiered contrastive reasoning,\nwhere the LLM compares high, medium, and low quality prompts to refine its own\ngeneration through reflective reasoning, and (2) multi-metric contrastive\nreasoning, where the LLM analyzes the best prompts along each evaluation\ndimension and integrates their strengths into an optimized prompt. By\nexplicitly contrasting high and low quality exemplars, CRPO enables the model\nto deduce why certain prompts succeed while others fail, thereby achieving more\nrobust and interpretable optimization.

Existing speech-driven approaches often produce oversimplified,\nemotionally flat, and semantically inconsistent results, which are insufficient\nfor singing animation.

Existing truncated sampling techniques, including\ntemperature scaling, top-\\$p\\$ (nucleus) sampling, and min-\\$p\\$ sampling, aim\nto manage this trade-off. However, they exhibit limitations, particularly in\nthe effective incorporation of the confidence of the model into the\ncorresponding sampling strategy. For example, min-\\$p\\$ sampling relies on a\nsingle top token as a heuristic for confidence, eventually underutilizing the\ninformation of the probability distribution. Toward effective incorporation of\nthe confidence of the model, in this paper, we present **top-H** decoding. We\nfirst establish the theoretical foundation of the interplay between creativity\nand coherence in truncated sampling by formulating an **entropy-constrained\nminimum divergence** problem. We then prove this minimization problem to be\nequivalent to an **entropy-constrained mass maximization** (ECMM) problem,\nwhich is NP-hard. Finally, we present top-H decoding, a computationally\nefficient greedy algorithm to solve the ECMM problem. Extensive empirical\nevaluations demonstrate that top-H outperforms the state-of-the-art (SoTA)\nalternative of min-\\$p\\$ sampling by up to **25.63%** on creative writing\nbenchmarks, while maintaining robustness on question-answering datasets such as\nGPQA, GSM8K, and MT-Bench. Additionally, an *LLM-as-judge* evaluation confirms\nthat top-H indeed produces coherent outputs even at higher temperatures, where\ncreativity is especially critical. In summary, top-H advances SoTA in\nopen-ended text generation and can be *easily integrated* into creative writing\napplications.

Among existing approaches,\nnative full-duplex models merges different channels (e.g. listen and speak) in\na single time step, overcoming the high response latency inherent to\ntime-division multiplexing time-division multiplexing (TDM) alternatives. Yet,\na key challenge remains: aligning textual monologues with audio streams that\noperate at different bitrates. The prevailing solution relies on word-level\nalignment, but this can degrade the language ability of large pre-trained\nmodels. Moreover, it requires highly accurate timestamps for every token, which\nintroduces cascading errors and increases pre-processing costs. In this paper,\nwe propose textual monologues in continuous tokens sequence, namely \"natural\"\nmonologues, which mimics humanoid cognitive behavior in dialogs. For temporal\nalignment, we alternate the position of the natural monologue - leading or\ntrailing the audio - across different training stages. This \"dual\" training\nparadigm proves highly effective in building FLM-Audio, our 7B spoken dialog\nmodel that demonstrates superior responsiveness, duplexity, and chatting\nexperiences, as confirmed by experimental results."}

In\ncontrast, humans, living in a 3D world, depend more on physical properties-such\nas distance, size, and shape-than on texture when interacting with objects.\nSince such 3D geometric information can be acquired from widely available depth\ncameras, it appears feasible to endow robots with similar perceptual\ncapabilities. Our pilot study found that using depth cameras for manipulation\nis challenging, primarily due to their limited accuracy and susceptibility to\nvarious types of noise. In this work, we propose Camera Depth Models (CDMs) as\na simple plugin on daily-use depth cameras, which take RGB images and raw depth\nsignals as input and output denoised, accurate metric depth. To achieve this,\nwe develop a neural data engine that generates high-quality paired data from\nsimulation by modeling a depth camera's noise pattern. Our results show that\nCDMs achieve nearly simulation-level accuracy in depth prediction, effectively\nbridging the sim-to-real gap for manipulation tasks. Notably, our experiments\ndemonstrate, for the first time, that a policy trained on raw simulated depth,\nwithout the need for adding noise or real-world fine-tuning, generalizes\nseamlessly to real-world robots on two challenging long-horizon tasks involving\narticulated, reflective, and slender objects, with little to no performance\ndegradation. We hope our findings will inspire future research in utilizing\nsimulation data and 3D information in general robot policies."}

Most model merging techniques have hyperparameters, and\ntheir setting affects the performance of the merged model. Because several\nexisting works show that tuning hyperparameters in model merging can enhance\nthe merging outcome, developing hyperparameter optimization algorithms for\nmodel merging is a promising direction. However, its optimization process is\ncomputationally expensive, particularly in merging LLMs. In this work, we\ndevelop surrogate benchmarks for optimization of the merging hyperparameters to\nrealize algorithm development and performance comparison at low cost.
