This paper presents a\ncomprehensive, multi-faceted framework designed to bridge the gap between\nisolated predictive modeling and an interactive system for psychological\nanalysis. The methodology encompasses a rigorous, end-to-end development\nlifecycle. First, foundational performance benchmarks were established on four\ndiverse psychological datasets using classical machine learning techniques.\nSecond, state-of-the-art transformer models were fine-tuned, a process that\nnecessitated the development of effective solutions to overcome critical\nengineering challenges, including the resolution of numerical instability in\nregression tasks and the creation of a systematic workflow for conducting\nlarge-scale training under severe resource constraints. Third, a generative\nlarge language model (LLM) was fine-tuned using parameter-efficient techniques\nto function as an interactive \"Personality Brain.\" Finally, the entire suite of\npredictive and generative models was architected and deployed as a robust,\nscalable microservices ecosystem. Key findings include the successful\nstabilization of transformer-based regression models for affective computing,\nshowing meaningful predictive performance where standard approaches failed, and\nthe development of a replicable methodology for democratizing large-scale AI\nresearch.

Gradient-based methods solve this problem in artificial neural\nnetworks using back-propagation, however, not in the most efficient way. For\ninstance, back-propagation requires a chain of top-down gradient computations.\nThis leads to an expensive optimization process in terms of computing power and\nmemory linked with well-known weight transport and update locking problems. To\naddress these shortcomings, we take a NeuroAI approach and draw inspiration\nfrom neural Reinforcement Learning to develop a derivative-free optimizer for\ntraining neural networks, Dopamine. Dopamine is developed for Weight\nPerturbation (WP) learning that exploits stochastic updating of weights towards\noptima. It achieves this by minimizing the regret, a form of Reward Prediction\nError (RPE) between the expected outcome from the perturbed model and the\nactual outcome from the unperturbed model. We use this RPE to adjust the\nlearning rate in the network (i.e., creating an adaptive learning rate\nstrategy, similar to the role of dopamine in the brain). We tested the Dopamine\noptimizer for training multi-layered perceptrons for XOR tasks, and recurrent\nneural networks for chaotic time series forecasting. Dopamine-trained models\ndemonstrate accelerated convergence and outperform standard WP, and give\ncomparable performance to gradient-based algorithms, while consuming\nsignificantly less computation and memory. Overall, the Dopamine optimizer not\nonly finds robust solutions and comparable performance to the state-of-the-art\nMachine Learning optimizers but is also neurobiologically more plausible."}

However, these models face a\nfundamental challenge when processing raw biomolecular sequences: the\ntokenization dilemma. Whether treating sequences as a specialized language,\nrisking the loss of functional motif information, or as a separate modality,\nintroducing formidable alignment challenges, current strategies fundamentally\nlimit their reasoning capacity. We challenge this sequence-centric paradigm by\npositing that a more effective strategy is to provide Sci-LLMs with high-level\nstructured context derived from established bioinformatics tools, thereby\nbypassing the need to interpret low-level noisy sequence data directly. Through\na systematic comparison of leading Sci-LLMs on biological reasoning tasks, we\ntested three input modes: sequence-only, context-only, and a combination of\nboth. Our findings are striking: the context-only approach consistently and\nsubstantially outperforms all other modes. Even more revealing, the inclusion\nof the raw sequence alongside its high-level context consistently degrades\nperformance, indicating that raw sequences act as informational noise, even for\nmodels with specialized tokenization schemes. These results suggest that the\nprimary strength of existing Sci-LLMs lies not in their nascent ability to\ninterpret biomolecular syntax from scratch, but in their profound capacity for\nreasoning over structured, human-readable knowledge. Therefore, we argue for\nreframing Sci-LLMs not as sequence decoders, but as powerful reasoning engines\nover expert knowledge.

To address these challenges, we propose an end to end, multi task\nsystem that generates factually grounded textual listings from a single image.\nThe contributions of this study are two proposals for the model architecture.\nFirst, application of multi task learning approach for fine tuning a vision\nencoder where a single vision backbone is jointly trained on attribute\nprediction such as color, hemline and neck style and price regression. Second,\nintroduction of a hierarchical generation process where the model's own\npredicted attributes are embedded in a prompt and fed to the text decoder to\nimprove factual consistency. The experiments demonstrate the superiority of\nthis architecture. The multi tasking approach outperforms both the independent\nprice regression, with a 3.6% better R2 Value and attribute classification,\nwith a 6.6% improvement F1 score. Critically, the hierarchical generation\nprocess proves highly effective, slashing the factual hallucination rate from\n12.7% to 7.1%, a 44.5% relative reduction, compared to a non hierarchical\nablation. The hierarchical approach also reduces the latency of the\nautoregressive text generation process by a factor of 3.5 when compared to\ndirect vision to language model of similar size. One minor caveat is that the\nmodel does perform 3.5% worse than direct vision-to-language model on ROUGE-L\nscore."}

The flow-based view, related to normalizing flows, treats generation\nas following a smooth path that moves samples from noise to data under a\nlearned velocity field. These perspectives share a common backbone: a\ntime-dependent velocity field whose flow transports a simple prior to the data.\nSampling then amounts to solving a differential equation that evolves noise\ninto data along a continuous trajectory.

The\nmodel was trained using Quantization-Aware Training (QAT) with 8-bit precision\non the Cityscapes dataset, reducing memory footprint by a factor of four while\nenabling efficient fixed-point computations. Necessary modifications were\napplied to adapt the model to CGRA4ML constraints, including simplifying skip\nconnections, employing hardware-friendly operations such as depthwise-separable\nand 1A-1 convolutions, and redesigning parts of the Flatten Transformer. Our\nimplementation achieves approximately 90% pixel accuracy and 45% mean\nIntersection-over-Union (mIoU), operating in real-time at 20 frames per second\n(FPS) with 50.1 ms latency on the ZCU104 FPGA board. The results demonstrate\nthe potential of CGRA4ML, with its flexibility in mapping modern layers and\noff-chip memory utilization for skip connections, provides a path for\nimplementing advanced semantic segmentation networks on FPGA for real-time\napplications to outperform traditional GPU solutions in terms of power\nefficiency while maintaining competitive accuracy.

Although practical demonstrations of QITE and its potential\nadvantages over the general VQA trained with vanilla gradient descent (GD) in\ncertain tasks have been reported, a first-principle, theoretical understanding\nof QITE remains limited. Here, we aim to develop an analytic theory for the\ndynamics of QITE. First, we show that QITE can be interpreted as a form of a\ngeneral VQA trained with Quantum Natural Gradient Descent (QNGD), where the\ninverse quantum Fisher information matrix serves as the learning-rate tensor.\nThis equivalence is established not only at the level of gradient update rules,\nbut also through the action principle: the variational principle can be\ndirectly connected to the geometric geodesic distance in the quantum Fisher\ninformation metric, up to an integration constant. Second, for wide quantum\nneural networks, we employ the quantum neural tangent kernel framework to\nconstruct an analytic model for QITE. We prove that QITE always converges\nfaster than GD-based VQA, though this advantage is suppressed by the\nexponential growth of Hilbert space dimension. This helps explain certain\nexperimental results in quantum computational chemistry. Our theory encompasses\nlinear, quadratic, and more general loss functions. We validate the analytic\nresults through numerical simulations. Our findings establish a theoretical\nfoundation for QITE dynamics and provide analytic insights for the\nfirst-principle design of variational quantum algorithms."}

We study two aspects of the problem: (1) the technical\nmethod for implementing confidence calibration and improving the reliability of\ncode generation models, and (2) the human-centered design principles for\neffectively communicating reliability signal to developers. First, we develop a\nscalable and flexible calibration framework which can be used to obtain\ncalibration weights for open-source models using any dataset, and evaluate\nwhether calibrators improve the alignment between model confidence and\ndeveloper acceptance behavior. Through a large-scale analysis of over 24\nmillion real-world developer interactions across multiple programming\nlanguages, we find that a general, post-hoc calibration model based on\nPlatt-scaling does not, on average, improve the reliability of model confidence\nsignals. We also find that while dynamically personalizing calibration to\nindividual users can be effective, its effectiveness is highly dependent on the\nvolume of user interaction data. Second, we conduct a multi-phase design study\nwith 3 expert designers and 153 professional developers, combining\nscenario-based design, semi-structured interviews, and survey validation,\nrevealing a clear preference for presenting reliability signals via\nnon-numerical, color-coded indicators within the in-editor code generation\nworkflow."}

To address the resulting misalignment in\nlearned representations, we propose a new federated learning framework\nfeaturing locally adaptive representations based on learnable client-side\nembedding controls that encode each client's data-missing patterns.\n  These embeddings serve as reconfiguration signals that align the globally\naggregated representation with each client's local context, enabling more\neffective use of shared information.

Our approach\nprogressively increases the patch size during model training, resulting in an\nimproved class balance for smaller patch sizes and accelerated convergence of\nthe training process. We evaluate our curriculum approach in two settings: a\nresource-efficient mode and a performance mode, both regarding Dice score\nperformance and computational costs across 15 diverse and popular 3D medical\nimage segmentation tasks. The resource-efficient mode matches the Dice score\nperformance of the conventional constant patch size sampling baseline with a\nnotable reduction in training time to only 44%. The performance mode improves\nupon constant patch size segmentation results, achieving a statistically\nsignificant relative mean performance gain of 1.28% in Dice Score. Remarkably,\nacross all 15 tasks, our proposed performance mode manages to surpass the\nconstant patch size baseline in Dice Score performance, while simultaneously\nreducing training time to only 89%. The benefits are particularly pronounced\nfor highly imbalanced tasks such as lesion segmentation tasks. Rigorous\nexperiments demonstrate that our performance mode not only improves mean\nsegmentation performance but also reduces performance variance, yielding more\ntrustworthy model comparison. Furthermore, our findings reveal that the\nproposed curriculum sampling is not tied to a specific architecture but\nrepresents a broadly applicable strategy that consistently boosts performance\nacross diverse segmentation models, including UNet, UNETR, and SwinUNETR. In\nsummary, we show that this simple yet elegant transformation on input data\nsubstantially improves both Dice Score performance and training runtime, while\nbeing compatible across diverse segmentation backbones."}
