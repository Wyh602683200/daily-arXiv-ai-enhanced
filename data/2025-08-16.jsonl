A key obstacle lies in the complexity\nand variability of natural language: essentially equivalent problems often\nappear in diverse surface forms, often obscured by redundant or distracting\ndetails. This imposes a dual burden on SLMs: they must first extract the core\nproblem from complex linguistic input, and then perform reasoning based on that\nunderstanding. The resulting vast and noisy problem space hinders optimization,\nparticularly for models with limited capacity. To address this, we propose a\nnew framework that decouples understanding from reasoning by mapping natural\nlanguage problems into a canonical problem space-a semantically simplified yet\nexpressive domain.

Within this framework, we introduce\nDURIT (Decoupled Understanding from Reasoning via Iterative Training), a\nthree-step algorithm that iteratively: (1) mapping natural language problems\nvia reinforcement learning, (2) aligns reasoning trajectories through\nself-distillation, and (3) trains reasoning policies in the problem space.

Mission planners must now account not only for mission-specific\nrequirements but also for the increasing collision risk with active satellites\nand space debris. This work presents a reinforcement learning framework using\nthe Advantage Actor-Critic (A2C) algorithm to optimize satellite orbital\nparameters for precise terrestrial coverage within predefined surface radii. By\nformulating the problem as a Markov Decision Process (MDP) within a custom\nOpenAI Gymnasium environment, our method simulates orbital dynamics using\nclassical Keplerian elements. The agent progressively learns to adjust five of\nthe orbital parameters - semi-major axis, eccentricity, inclination, right\nascension of ascending node, and the argument of perigee-to achieve targeted\nterrestrial coverage. Comparative evaluation against Proximal Policy\nOptimization (PPO) demonstrates A2C's superior performance, achieving 5.8x\nhigher cumulative rewards (10.0 vs 9.263025) while converging in 31.5x fewer\ntimesteps (2,000 vs 63,000). The A2C agent consistently meets mission\nobjectives across diverse target coordinates while maintaining computational\nefficiency suitable for real-time mission planning applications. Key\ncontributions include: (1) a TLE-based orbital simulation environment\nincorporating physics constraints, (2) validation of actor-critic methods'\nsuperiority over trust region approaches in continuous orbital control, and (3)\ndemonstration of rapid convergence enabling adaptive satellite deployment. This\napproach establishes reinforcement learning as a computationally efficient\nalternative for scalable and intelligent LEO mission planning."}

By\ngenerating tokens in parallel through an iterative denoising process, DLMs\npossess inherent advantages in reducing inference latency and capturing\nbidirectional context, thereby enabling fine-grained control over the\ngeneration process. While achieving a several-fold speed-up, recent\nadvancements have allowed DLMs to show performance comparable to their\nautoregressive counterparts, making them a compelling choice for various\nnatural language processing tasks. In this survey, we provide a holistic\noverview of the current DLM landscape. We trace its evolution and relationship\nwith other paradigms, such as autoregressive and masked language models, and\ncover both foundational principles and state-of-the-art models. Our work offers\nan up-to-date, comprehensive taxonomy and an in-depth analysis of current\ntechniques, from pre-training strategies to advanced post-training methods.\nAnother contribution of this survey is a thorough review of DLM inference\nstrategies and optimizations, including improvements in decoding parallelism,\ncaching mechanisms, and generation quality. We also highlight the latest\napproaches to multimodal extensions of DLMs and delineate their applications\nacross various practical scenarios. Furthermore, our discussion addresses the\nlimitations and challenges of DLMs, including efficiency, long-sequence\nhandling, and infrastructure requirements, while outlining future research\ndirections to sustain progress in this rapidly evolving field.

These dynamic\ndialogues enable adaptive attack strategies that can cause severe privacy\nviolations, yet their evolving nature makes it difficult to anticipate and\ndiscover sophisticated vulnerabilities manually. To tackle this problem, we\npresent a search-based framework that alternates between improving attacker and\ndefender instructions by simulating privacy-critical agent interactions. Each\nsimulation involves three roles: data subject, data sender, and data recipient.\nWhile the data subject's behavior is fixed, the attacker (data recipient)\nattempts to extract sensitive information from the defender (data sender)\nthrough persistent and interactive exchanges. To explore this interaction space\nefficiently, our search algorithm employs LLMs as optimizers, using parallel\nsearch with multiple threads and cross-thread propagation to analyze simulation\ntrajectories and iteratively propose new instructions. Through this process, we\nfind that attack strategies escalate from simple direct requests to\nsophisticated multi-turn tactics such as impersonation and consent forgery,\nwhile defenses advance from rule-based constraints to identity-verification\nstate machines. The discovered attacks and defenses transfer across diverse\nscenarios and backbone models, demonstrating strong practical utility for\nbuilding privacy-aware agents."}

Despite recent\nadvances in AI, existing methods often handle these stages separately, leading\nto error accumulation and artifacts. For instance, inbetweening approaches\nstruggle with large motions, while colorization methods require dense per-frame\nsketches. To address this, we introduce ToonComposer, a generative model that\nunifies inbetweening and colorization into a single post-keyframing stage.\nToonComposer employs a sparse sketch injection mechanism to provide precise\ncontrol using keyframe sketches. Additionally, it uses a cartoon adaptation\nmethod with the spatial low-rank adapter to tailor a modern video foundation\nmodel to the cartoon domain while keeping its temporal prior intact. Requiring\nas few as a single sketch and a colored reference frame, ToonComposer excels\nwith sparse inputs, while also supporting multiple sketches at any temporal\nlocation for more precise motion control. This dual capability reduces manual\nworkload and improves flexibility, empowering artists in real-world scenarios.\nTo evaluate our model, we further created PKBench, a benchmark featuring\nhuman-drawn sketches that simulate real-world use cases. Our evaluation\ndemonstrates that ToonComposer outperforms existing methods in visual quality,\nmotion consistency, and production efficiency, offering a superior and more\nflexible solution for AI-assisted cartoon production."}

The influence of various parameter selections and their value\nadjustments, as well as architectural changes made to an Echo State Network, a\npowerful recurrent neural network configured as a reservoir computer, can be\nchallenging to fully comprehend without experience in the field, and even some\nhyperparameter optimization algorithms may have difficulty adjusting parameter\nvalues without proper manual selections made first. Therefore, it is imperative\nto understand the effects of parameters and their value selection on Echo State\nNetwork architecture performance for a successful build. Thus, to address the\nrequirement for an extensive background in Echo State Network architecture, as\nwell as examine how Echo State Network performance is affected with respect to\nvariations in architecture, design, and parameter selection and values, a\nseries of benchmark tasks representing different problem domains, including\ntime series prediction, pattern generation, chaotic system prediction, and time\nseries classification, were modeled and experimented on to show the impact on\nthe performance of Echo State Network."}
