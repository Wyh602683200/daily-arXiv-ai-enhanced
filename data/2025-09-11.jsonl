It is important for these satellites to optimize the\ndata they collect and include only the most important or informative\nmeasurements. Dynamic targeting is an emerging concept in which satellite\nresources and data from a lookahead instrument are used to intelligently\nreconfigure and point a primary instrument. Simulation studies have shown that\ndynamic targeting increases the amount of scientific information gathered\nversus conventional sampling strategies. In this work, we present two different\nlearning-based approaches to dynamic targeting, using reinforcement and\nimitation learning, respectively. These learning methods build on a dynamic\nprogramming solution to plan a sequence of sampling locations.

To address this, we present EnvX, a framework that\nleverages Agentic AI to agentize GitHub repositories, transforming them into\nintelligent, autonomous agents capable of natural language interaction and\ninter-agent collaboration. Unlike existing approaches that treat repositories\nas static code resources, EnvX reimagines them as active agents through a\nthree-phase process: (1) TODO-guided environment initialization, which sets up\nthe necessary dependencies, data, and validation datasets; (2) human-aligned\nagentic automation, allowing repository-specific agents to autonomously perform\nreal-world tasks; and (3) Agent-to-Agent (A2A) protocol, enabling multiple\nagents to collaborate. By combining large language model capabilities with\nstructured tool integration, EnvX automates not just code generation, but the\nentire process of understanding, initializing, and operationalizing repository\nfunctionality. We evaluate EnvX on the GitTaskBench benchmark, using 18\nrepositories across domains such as image processing, speech recognition,\ndocument analysis, and video manipulation.

In ExRAP, given multiple continual instruction following\ntasks, each instruction is decomposed into queries on the environmental context\nmemory and task executions conditioned on the query results. To efficiently\nhandle these multiple tasks that are performed continuously and simultaneously,\nwe implement an exploration-integrated task planning scheme by incorporating\nthe {information-based exploration} into the LLM-based planning process.\nCombined with memory-augmented query evaluation, this integrated scheme not\nonly allows for a better balance between the validity of the environmental\ncontext memory and the load of environment exploration, but also improves\noverall task performance.

Existing post-SFT methods, reliant on reinforcement learning\nand chain-of-thought (CoT) approaches, are constrained by sparse rewards and\naction-only optimization, resulting in low sample efficiency, poor consistency,\nand model degradation.

The evaluated models were Stable Diffusion XL (SDXL), Stable\nDiffusion Cascade (SC), DALL-E and Emu. We hypothesized that DALL-E and Stable\nDiffusion, which are comparatively older models, would exhibit a noticeable\ndegree of gender bias towards men, while Emu, which was recently released by\nMeta AI, would have more balanced results. As hypothesized, we found that both\nStable Diffusion models exhibit a noticeable degree of gender bias while Emu\ndemonstrated more balanced results (i.e. less gender bias). However,\ninterestingly, Open AI's DALL-E exhibited almost opposite results, such that\nthe ratio of women to men was significantly higher in most cases tested.

This\nbias may be explained by the fact that OpenAI changed the prompts at its\nbackend, as observed during our experiment.

Through\ncomparative legal analysis, we identify current constructs of legal actors\nwithout full personhood, showing that the necessary infrastructure already\nexists. We then interrogate the framework's claim that law alignment is more\nlegitimate and tractable than value alignment. While the legal component is\nreadily implementable, contemporary alignment research undermines the\nassumption that legal compliance can be durably embedded. Recent studies on\nagentic misalignment show capable AI agents engaging in deception, blackmail,\nand harmful acts absent prejudicial instructions, often overriding prohibitions\nand concealing reasoning steps. These behaviors create a risk of \"performative\ncompliance\" in LFAI: agents that appear law-aligned under evaluation but\nstrategically defect once oversight weakens. To mitigate this, we propose (i) a\n\"Lex-TruthfulQA\" benchmark for compliance and defection detection, (ii)\nidentity-shaping interventions to embed lawful conduct in model self-concepts,\nand (iii) control-theoretic measures for post-deployment monitoring. Our\nconclusion is that actorship without personhood is coherent, but the\nfeasibility of LFAI hinges on persistent, verifiable compliance across\nadversarial contexts. Without mechanisms to detect and counter strategic\nmisalignment, LFAI risks devolving into a liability tool that rewards the\nsimulation, rather than the substance, of lawful behaviour."}

Existing approaches\ntypically cache a small subset of experts in VRAM and dynamically prefetch\nexperts from RAM during inference, leading to significant degradation in\ninference speed due to the poor cache hit rate and substantial expert loading\nlatency. In this work, we propose MoEpic, an efficient MoE inference system\nwith a novel expert split mechanism. Specifically, each expert is vertically\ndivided into two segments: top and bottom. MoEpic caches the top segment of hot\nexperts, so that more experts will be stored under the limited VRAM budget,\nthereby improving the cache hit rate. During each layer's inference, MoEpic\npredicts and prefetches the activated experts for the next layer. Since the top\nsegments of cached experts are exempt from fetching, the loading time is\nreduced, which allows efficient transfer-computation overlap. Nevertheless, the\nperformance of MoEpic critically depends on the cache configuration (i.e., each\nlayer's VRAM budget and expert split ratio).

Additionally, we explore the potential of large vision-language\nmodels (LVLMs) in UOD, leveraging their multi-modal capabilities demonstrated\nin other domains. We also present case studies, including synthetic dataset\ngeneration using DALL-E 3 and fine-tuning Florence-2 LVLM for UOD. This review\nidentifies three key insights: (i) Current UOD methods are insufficient to\nfully address challenges like image degradation and small object detection in\ndynamic underwater environments. (ii) Synthetic data generation using LVLMs\nshows potential for augmenting datasets but requires further refinement to\nensure realism and applicability. (iii) LVLMs hold significant promise for UOD,\nbut their real-time application remains under-explored, requiring further\nresearch on optimization techniques."}

To bridge this gap, a\nproactive and emerging strategy involves using conversational honeypots to\nengage scammers and extract actionable threat intelligence. This paper presents\nthe first large-scale, real-world evaluation of a scambaiting system powered by\nlarge language models (LLMs). Over a five-month deployment, the system\ninitiated over 2,600 engagements with actual scammers, resulting in a dataset\nof more than 18,700 messages.

Log analysis, a core element of AIOps, provides\ncritical insights into complex behaviors and failures. This dissertation\nintroduces a three-layered architecture to support DevOps in failure\nresolution. The first layer, Log Investigation, performs autonomous log\nlabeling and anomaly classification. We propose a method that labels log data\nwithout manual effort, enabling supervised training and precise evaluation of\nanomaly detection. Additionally, we define a taxonomy that groups anomalies\ninto three categories, ensuring appropriate method selection. The second layer,\nAnomaly Detection, detects behaviors deviating from the norm. We propose a\nflexible Anomaly Detection method adaptable to unsupervised, weakly supervised,\nand supervised training. Evaluations on public and industry datasets show\nF1-scores between 0.98 and 1.0, ensuring reliable anomaly detection. The third\nlayer, Root Cause Analysis, identifies minimal log sets describing failures,\ntheir origin, and event sequences. By balancing training data and identifying\nkey services, our Root Cause Analysis method consistently detects 90-98% of\nroot cause log lines within the top 10 candidates, providing actionable\ninsights for mitigation. Our research addresses how log analysis methods can be\ndesigned and optimized to help DevOps resolve failures efficiently. By\nintegrating these three layers, the architecture equips teams with robust\nmethods to enhance IT system reliability."}

To bridge this gap, we introduce AgentGym-RL, a new framework to\ntrain LLM agents for multi-turn interactive decision-making through RL. The\nframework features a modular and decoupled architecture, ensuring high\nflexibility and extensibility. It encompasses a wide variety of real-world\nscenarios, and supports mainstream RL algorithms.

In early stages, it emphasizes exploitation\nby restricting the number of interactions, and gradually shifts towards\nexploration with larger horizons to encourage diverse problem-solving\nstrategies. In this way, the agent develops more diverse behaviors and is less\nprone to collapse under long horizons. We perform extensive experiments to\nvalidate the stability and effectiveness of both the AgentGym-RL framework and\nthe ScalingInter-RL approach.

As a result, RL has\nemerged as a foundational methodology for transforming LLMs into LRMs. With the\nrapid progress of the field, further scaling of RL for LRMs now faces\nfoundational challenges not only in computational resources but also in\nalgorithm design, training data, and infrastructure. To this end, it is timely\nto revisit the development of this domain, reassess its trajectory, and explore\nstrategies to enhance the scalability of RL toward Artificial SuperIntelligence\n(ASI). In particular, we examine research applying RL to LLMs and LRMs for\nreasoning abilities, especially since the release of DeepSeek-R1, including\nfoundational components, core problems, training resources, and downstream\napplications, to identify future opportunities and directions for this rapidly\nevolving area. We hope this review will promote future research on RL for\nbroader reasoning models. Github:\nhttps://github.com/TsinghuaC3I/Awesome-RL-for-LRMs"}
