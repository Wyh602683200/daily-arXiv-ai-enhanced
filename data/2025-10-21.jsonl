This\npaper introduces the Structured Cognitive Loop (SCL) as an executable\nepistemological framework for emergent intelligence. Unlike traditional AI\nresearch asking \"what is intelligence?\" (ontological), SCL asks \"under what\nconditions does cognition emerge?\" (epistemological). Grounded in philosophy of\nmind and cognitive phenomenology, SCL bridges conceptual philosophy and\nimplementable cognition. Drawing on process philosophy, enactive cognition, and\nextended mind theory, we define intelligence not as a property but as a\nperformed process -- a continuous loop of judgment, memory, control, action,\nand regulation. SCL makes three contributions. First, it operationalizes\nphilosophical insights into computationally interpretable structures, enabling\n\"executable epistemology\" -- philosophy as structural experiment. Second, it\nshows that functional separation within cognitive architecture yields more\ncoherent and interpretable behavior than monolithic prompt based systems,\nsupported by agent evaluations. Third, it redefines intelligence: not\nrepresentational accuracy but the capacity to reconstruct its own epistemic\nstate through intentional understanding. This framework impacts philosophy of\nmind, epistemology, and AI. For philosophy, it allows theories of cognition to\nbe enacted and tested. For AI, it grounds behavior in epistemic structure\nrather than statistical regularity. For epistemology, it frames knowledge not\nas truth possession but as continuous reconstruction within a\nphenomenologically coherent loop. We situate SCL within debates on cognitive\nphenomenology, emergence, normativity, and intentionality, arguing that real\nprogress requires not larger models but architectures that realize cognitive\nprinciples structurally."}

We observe that access to an environment interface does not delay or\neradicate performance collapse. Furthermore, LLM-parameterized policy analysis\nreveals increasing divergence from both optimal policies and uniformly random\npolicies, suggesting that the model exhibits mode-like collapse at each level\nof complexity, and that performance is dependent upon whether the mode reflects\nthe correct solution for the problem.

We\nfirst position Reinforcement Learning (RL) as the algorithmic engine enabling\nthis paradigm shift. By reframing learning from imitating static data to\noutcome-driven exploration, RL underpins a unified solution of LLM + RL + Task\nacross language, vision and embodied domains. Building on this, the survey\nsystematically reviews how each capability -- Planning, Tool use, and Memory --\nhas evolved from externally scripted modules to end-to-end learned behaviors.\nFurthermore, it examines how this paradigm shift has reshaped major agent\napplications, specifically the Deep Research agent emphasizing long-horizon\nreasoning and the GUI agent emphasizing embodied interaction. We conclude by\ndiscussing the continued internalization of agentic capabilities like\nMulti-agent collaboration and Reflection, alongside the evolving roles of the\nsystem and model layers in future agentic AI.

This strategy can generate both truthful and\nhallucinated data under prompt guidance at a relatively low cost. To more\neffectively evaluate the truthfulness of the sparse intermediate embeddings\nproduced by LLMs, we introduce an estimation metric called the Contrastive\nMahalanobis Score (CM Score). This score is based on modeling the distributions\nof truthful and hallucinated data in the activation space. CM Score employs a\nmatrix decomposition approach to more accurately capture the underlying\nstructure of these distributions. Importantly, our framework does not require\nadditional human annotations, offering strong generalizability and practicality\nfor real-world applications. Extensive experiments demonstrate that PALE\nachieves superior hallucination detection performance, outperforming the\ncompetitive baseline by a significant margin of 6.55%."}

Reporting times decreased from $88 \\pm 38$\ns (FT) to $37 \\pm 18$ s (SR) and $25 \\pm 9$ s (AI-SR) ($P < .001$). Saccade\ncounts for the radiograph field ($205 \\pm 135$ (FT), $123 \\pm 88$ (SR), $97 \\pm\n58$ (AI-SR)) and total fixation duration for the report field ($11 \\pm 5$ s\n(FT), $5 \\pm 3$ s (SR), $4 \\pm 1$ s (AI-SR)) were lower with SR and AI-SR ($P <\n.001$ each).

While debiasing learning has been\nextensively studied, they mostly focused on the specialized (called\ncounterfactual) test environment simulated by random exposure of items,\nsignificantly degrading accuracy in the typical (called factual) test\nenvironment based on actual user-item interactions. In fact, each test\nenvironment highlights the benefit of a different aspect: the counterfactual\ntest emphasizes user satisfaction in the long-terms, while the factual test\nfocuses on predicting subsequent user behaviors on platforms. Therefore, it is\ndesirable to have a model that performs well on both tests rather than only\none. In this work, we introduce a new learning framework, called Bias-adaptive\nPreference distillation Learning (BPL), to gradually uncover user preferences\nwith dual distillation strategies. These distillation strategies are designed\nto drive high performance in both factual and counterfactual test environments.\nEmploying a specialized form of teacher-student distillation from a biased\nmodel, BPL retains accurate preference knowledge aligned with the collected\nfeedback, leading to high performance in the factual test. Furthermore, through\nself-distillation with reliability filtering, BPL iteratively refines its\nknowledge throughout the training process. This enables the model to produce\nmore accurate predictions across a broader range of user-item combinations,\nthereby improving performance in the counterfactual test.

A promising approach is to reconstruct\nvisual stimuli, essentially images, from functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging\n(fMRI) signals.

The reconstruction quality depends on how similar the latent space is\nto the structure of neural activity and how well the generative model produces\nimages from that space. Yet, it remains unclear which type of latent space best\nsupports this transformation and how it should be organized to represent visual\nstimuli effectively. We present two key findings. First, fMRI signals are more\nsimilar to the text space of a language model than to either a vision based\nspace or a joint text image space. Second, text representations and the\ngenerative model should be adapted to capture the compositional nature of\nvisual stimuli, including objects, their detailed attributes, and\nrelationships.

Building on theoretical findings concerning the\nimpact of data typicality on the generalization properties of traditional\nstochastic gradient descent (SGD) and sharpness-aware minimization (SAM),\nSAMOSA actively queries samples based on their typicality. SAMOSA effectively\nidentifies atypical samples that belong to regions of the embedding manifold\nclose to the model decision boundaries. Therefore, SAMOSA prioritizes the\nsamples that are (i) highly informative for the targeted classes, and (ii)\nuseful for distinguishing between targeted and unwanted classes. Extensive\nexperiments show that SAMOSA achieves up to 3% accuracy improvement over the\nstate of the art across several datasets, while not introducing computational\noverhead.

This\nlow-rank, modular representation yields compact models: groups of neurons\nexchange low-dimensional signals, enabling intra-group specialization and\ninter-group information sharing while dramatically reducing redundant\nparameters. By drawing on dynamical systems theory, we introduce a neuronal\nstability metric (analogous to Lyapunov stability) that quantifies the\ncontraction of neuron activations toward stable patterns during sequence\nprocessing.

We address this limitation by introducing GACO-CAD, a novel\ntwo-stage post-training framework. It is designed to achieve a joint objective:\nsimultaneously improving the geometric accuracy of the generated CAD models and\nencouraging the use of more concise modeling procedures. First, during\nsupervised fine-tuning, we leverage depth and surface normal maps as dense\ngeometric priors, combining them with the RGB image to form a multi-channel\ninput. In the context of single-view reconstruction, these priors provide\ncomplementary spatial cues that help the MLLM more reliably recover 3D geometry\nfrom 2D observations. Second, during reinforcement learning, we introduce a\ngroup length reward that, while preserving high geometric fidelity, promotes\nthe generation of more compact and less redundant parametric modeling\nsequences. A simple dynamic weighting strategy is adopted to stabilize\ntraining. Experiments on the DeepCAD and Fusion360 datasets show that GACO-CAD\nachieves state-of-the-art performance under the same MLLM backbone,\nconsistently outperforming existing methods in terms of code validity,\ngeometric accuracy, and modeling conciseness."}

By portraying\nlocations as characters and movement as plot, we argue that data storytelling\ndrives insight, engagement, and action from spatio-temporal information. The\ncase study illustrates how MapMuse can bridge the gap between data complexity\nand human understanding. The aim of this short paper is to provide a glimpse to\nthe potential of the cinematic storytelling technique as an effective\ncommunication tool for spatio-temporal data, as well as to describe open\nproblems and opportunities for future research."}

Existing approaches often struggle to generate executable\ncode, primarily due to insufficient background knowledge and the limitations of\nretrieval-augmented generation (RAG) methods, which fail to capture latent\ntechnical details hidden in referenced papers. Furthermore, previous approaches\ntend to overlook valuable implementation-level code signals and lack structured\nknowledge representations that support multi-granular retrieval and reuse. To\novercome these challenges, we propose Executable Knowledge Graphs (xKG), a\nmodular and pluggable knowledge base that automatically integrates technical\ninsights, code snippets, and domain-specific knowledge extracted from\nscientific literature. When integrated into three agent frameworks with two\ndifferent LLMs, xKG shows substantial performance gains (10.9% with o3-mini) on\nPaperBench, demonstrating its effectiveness as a general and extensible\nsolution for automated AI research replication.

These components enable automated report\ngeneration, real-time streaming, and seamless enterprise deployment, as\nvalidated on internal datasets. On open-ended benchmarks including DeepResearch\nBench and DeepConsult, EDR outperforms state-of-the-art agentic systems without\nany human steering.

A popular strategy involves gradient low-rank\nprojection, storing only the projected optimizer states, with GaLore being a\nrepresentative example. However, a significant drawback of many such methods is\ntheir lack of convergence guarantees, as various low-rank projection approaches\nintroduce inherent biases relative to the original optimization algorithms,\nwhich contribute to performance gaps compared to full-parameter training.\nAiming to tackle this problem, this paper investigates the layerwise sampling\ntechnique for debiasing low-rank projection mechanisms. In particular, an\ninstantiation of the paradigm gives rise to a novel and unbiased low-rank\noptimization method built upon GaLore's mechanism and the Muon algorithm, named\nGaLore Unbiased with Muon (GUM). We theoretically prove our method matches the\nconvergence guarantees of the base Muon algorithm while preserving the memory\nefficiency of low-rank techniques. Empirical experiments on LLM fine-tuning and\npretraining also demonstrate non-trivial improvements over GaLore and even\nbetter performance than full-parameter training. Further investigation shows\nthat the improvement of this technique comes from a more uniform distribution\nof knowledge inside layers, leading to more efficient utilization of the model\nparameter space and better memorization."}
