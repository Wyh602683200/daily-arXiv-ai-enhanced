We evaluate both accuracy and computational efficiency (FLOPs) on\nRewardBench tasks, and further examine augmentation strategies for non-thinking\nmodels, including in-context learning, rubric-guided judging, reference-based\nevaluation, and n-best aggregation. Our results show that despite these\nenhancements, non-thinking models generally fall short of their thinking\ncounterparts. Our results show that thinking models achieve approximately 10%\npoints higher accuracy with little overhead (under 2x), in contrast to\naugmentation strategies like few-shot learning, which deliver modest gains at a\nhigher cost (>8x). Bias and robustness analyses further demonstrate that\nthinking models maintain significantly greater consistency under a variety of\nbias conditions such as positional, bandwagon, identity, diversity, and random\nbiases (6% higher on average).

Finally, THOR\nincorporates a self-correction mechanism that leverages immediate tool feedback\nto dynamically revise erroneous reasoning paths during inference. Our approach\ndemonstrates strong generalization across diverse models, performing\neffectively in both reasoning and non-reasoning models.

Studies that\nexamined machine learning or deep learning methods to determine the prognosis\nof COVID-19 using CT or chest X-ray images were included. Polled sensitivity,\nspecificity area under the curve and diagnostic odds ratio were calculated.\nResult: A total of 36 articles were included; various prognosis-related issues,\nincluding disease severity, mechanical ventilation or admission to the\nintensive care unit and mortality, were investigated.

Final views were processed through Tencent's\nHunyuan3D-2mini (384M parameters) for stereolithography file generation.\n  The pipeline successfully generated geometrically optimized 2D projections\nfrom single-view angiograms after 16 processing steps using a custom web\ninterface. Initial iterations contained hallucinated vascular features\nrequiring iterative refinement to achieve anatomically faithful\nrepresentations. Final projections demonstrated accurate preservation of\ncomplex Fontan geometry with enhanced contrast suitable for 3D conversion.\nAI-generated virtual flow visualization identified stagnation zones in central\nconnections and flow patterns in branch arteries. Complete processing required\nunder 15 minutes with second-level API response times.\n  This approach demonstrates clinical feasibility of generating CFD-suitable\ngeometries from routine angiographic data, enabling 3D generation and rapid\nvirtual flow visualization for cursory insights prior to full CFD simulation.\nWhile requiring refinement cycles for accuracy, this establishes foundation for\ndemocratizing advanced geometric and hemodynamic analysis using readily\navailable imaging data."}

In federated learning, each client trains a local model\nusing its own data. The trained models are periodically transmitted to the\ncentral server. The server then combines the received models using federated\naggregation algorithms to obtain a global model.

We challenge this view and demonstrate that explicit\nrepresentation alignment can supply critical information that bridges the\ndistributional gap between input histories and future targets. To this end, we\nintroduce TimeAlign, a lightweight, plug-and-play framework that learns\nauxiliary features via a simple reconstruction task and feeds them back to any\nbase forecaster. Extensive experiments across eight benchmarks verify its\nsuperior performance. Further studies indicate that the gains arises primarily\nfrom correcting frequency mismatches between historical inputs and future\noutputs. We also provide a theoretical justification for the effectiveness of\nTimeAlign in increasing the mutual information between learned representations\nand predicted targets. As it is architecture-agnostic and incurs negligible\noverhead, TimeAlign can serve as a general alignment module for modern deep\nlearning time-series forecasting systems. The code is available at\nhttps://github.com/TROUBADOUR000/TimeAlign."}

However, current video large language models (VLLMs) and\nbenchmarks mostly rely on low-frame-rate sampling, such as uniform sampling or\nkeyframe selection, discarding dense temporal information. This compromise\navoids the high cost of tokenizing every frame, which otherwise leads to\nredundant computation and linear token growth as video length increases. While\nthis trade-off works for slowly changing content, it fails for tasks like\nlecture comprehension, where information appears in nearly every frame and\nrequires precise temporal alignment. To address this gap, we introduce Dense\nVideo Understanding (DVU), which enables high-FPS video comprehension by\nreducing both tokenization time and token overhead. Existing benchmarks are\nalso limited, as their QA pairs focus on coarse content changes. We therefore\npropose DIVE (Dense Information Video Evaluation), the first benchmark designed\nfor dense temporal reasoning. To make DVU practical, we present Gated Residual\nTokenization (GRT), a two-stage framework: (1) Motion-Compensated Inter-Gated\nTokenization uses pixel-level motion estimation to skip static regions during\ntokenization, achieving sub-linear growth in token count and compute. (2)\nSemantic-Scene Intra-Tokenization Merging fuses tokens across static regions\nwithin a scene, further reducing redundancy while preserving dynamic semantics.\nExperiments on DIVE show that GRT outperforms larger VLLM baselines and scales\npositively with FPS. These results highlight the importance of dense temporal\ninformation and demonstrate that GRT enables efficient, scalable high-FPS video\nunderstanding."}

Preprint", "summary": "Stochastic optimization powers the scalability of modern artificial\nintelligence, spanning machine learning, deep learning, reinforcement learning,\nand large language model training. Yet, existing theory remains largely\nconfined to Hilbert spaces, relying on inner-product frameworks and\northogonality. This paradigm fails to capture non-Euclidean settings, such as\nmirror descent on simplices, Bregman proximal methods for sparse learning,\nnatural gradient descent in information geometry, or\nKullback--Leibler-regularized language model training. Unlike Euclidean-based\nHilbert-space methods, this approach embraces general Banach spaces. This work\nintroduces a pioneering Banach--Bregman framework for stochastic iterations,\nestablishing Bregman geometry as a foundation for next-generation optimization.\nIt (i) provides a unified template via Bregman projections and Bregman--Fejer\nmonotonicity, encompassing stochastic approximation, mirror descent, natural\ngradient, adaptive methods, and mirror-prox; (ii) establishes super-relaxations\n($\\lambda > 2$) in non-Hilbert settings, enabling flexible geometries and\nelucidating their acceleration effect; and (iii) delivers convergence theorems\nspanning almost-sure boundedness to geometric rates, validated on synthetic and\nreal-world tasks. Empirical studies across machine learning (UCI benchmarks),\ndeep learning (e.g., Transformer training), reinforcement learning\n(actor--critic), and large language models (WikiText-2 with distilGPT-2) show\nup to 20% faster convergence, reduced variance, and enhanced accuracy over\nclassical baselines. These results position Banach--Bregman geometry as a\ncornerstone unifying optimization theory and practice across core AI paradigms."}

Our setup involves creating a model with a known\ntraining order by sequentially fine-tuning Llama-3.2-1B on six disjoint but\notherwise similar datasets about named entities. We find that the average\nactivations of test samples for the six training datasets encode the training\norder: when projected into a 2D subspace, these centroids are arranged exactly\nin the order of training and lie on a straight line. Further, we show that\nlinear probes can accurately (~90%) distinguish \"early\" vs. \"late\" entities,\ngeneralizing to entities unseen during the probes' own training. The model can\nalso be fine-tuned to explicitly report an unseen entity's training stage (~80%\naccuracy). Interestingly, this temporal signal does not seem attributable to\nsimple differences in activation magnitudes, losses, or model confidence. Our\npaper demonstrates that models are capable of differentiating information by\nits acquisition time, and carries significant implications for how they might\nmanage conflicting data and respond to knowledge modifications."}
