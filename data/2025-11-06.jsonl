In this work, we\nsystematically evaluate a range of control protocols in SHADE-Arena, a dataset\nof diverse agentic environments. First, we evaluate blue team protocols,\nincluding deferral to trusted models, resampling, and deferring on critical\nactions, against a default attack policy. We find that resampling for\nincrimination and deferring on critical actions perform best, increasing safety\nfrom 50% to 96%. We then iterate on red team strategies against these protocols\nand find that attack policies with additional affordances, such as knowledge of\nwhen resampling occurs or the ability to simulate monitors, can substantially\nimprove attack success rates against our resampling strategy, decreasing safety\nto 17%. However, deferring on critical actions is highly robust to even our\nstrongest red team strategies, demonstrating the importance of denying attack\npolicies access to protocol internals."}

We present PublicAgent, a\nmulti-agent framework that addresses these limitations through decomposition\ninto specialized agents for intent clarification, dataset discovery, analysis,\nand reporting. This architecture maintains focused attention within agent\ncontexts and enables validation at each stage. Evaluation across five models\nand 50 queries derives five design principles for multi-agent LLM systems.\nFirst, specialization provides value independent of model strength--even the\nstrongest model shows 97.5% agent win rates, with benefits orthogonal to model\nscale. Second, agents divide into universal (discovery, analysis) and\nconditional (report, intent) categories. Universal agents show consistent\neffectiveness (std dev 12.4%) while conditional agents vary by model (std dev\n20.5%). Third, agents mitigate distinct failure modes--removing discovery or\nanalysis causes catastrophic failures (243-280 instances), while removing\nreport or intent causes quality degradation. Fourth, architectural benefits\npersist across task complexity with stable win rates (86-92% analysis, 84-94%\ndiscovery), indicating workflow management value rather than reasoning\nenhancement. Fifth, wide variance in agent effectiveness across models (42-96%\nfor analysis) requires model-aware architecture design. These principles guide\nwhen and why specialization is necessary for complex analytical workflows while\nenabling broader access to public data through natural language interfaces."}

In this paper, our goal\nis to build a benchmark for understanding the capabilities of LLMs in terms of\nknowledge of probability distributions describing the real world. Given that\nLLMs are trained on vast amounts of text, it may be plausible that they\ninternalize aspects of these distributions. Indeed, LLMs are touted as powerful\nuniversal approximators of real-world distributions. At the same time,\nclassical results in statistics, known as curse of dimensionality, highlight\nfundamental challenges in learning distributions in high dimensions,\nchallenging the notion of universal distributional learning. In this work, we\ndevelop the first benchmark to directly test this hypothesis, evaluating\nwhether LLMs have access to empirical distributions describing real-world\npopulations across domains such as economics, health, education, and social\nbehavior. Our results demonstrate that LLMs perform poorly overall, and do not\nseem to internalize real-world statistics naturally. When interpreted in the\ncontext of Pearl's Causal Hierarchy (PCH), our benchmark demonstrates that\nlanguage models do not contain knowledge on observational distributions (Layer\n1 of PCH), and thus the Causal Hierarchy Theorem implies that interventional\n(Layer 2) and counterfactual (Layer 3) knowledge of these models is also\nlimited."}

Part of this is due to the difficulty to clearly define quality in\nthe context of AI components, resulting in a lack of consensus on how to best\napproach Quality Assurance (QA) for these types of systems. To address this\nchallenge, this paper proposes both a quality model for AI agents based on the\nISO/IEC 25010 standard, and a domain specific language to support the\ndefinition of SLAs for the services provided by these AI agents."}

Specifically, a model was\npre-trained on 1,280 public tasks for 700k+ optimizer steps over 48 hours on\n4xH100 SXM GPUs to obtain a ~10% score on the public evaluation set.

This paper introduces Whisper Leak, a side-channel attack\nthat infers user prompt topics from encrypted LLM traffic by analyzing packet\nsize and timing patterns in streaming responses. Despite TLS encryption\nprotecting content, these metadata patterns leak sufficient information to\nenable topic classification. We demonstrate the attack across 28 popular LLMs\nfrom major providers, achieving near-perfect classification (often >98% AUPRC)\nand high precision even at extreme class imbalance (10,000:1 noise-to-target\nratio). For many models, we achieve 100% precision in identifying sensitive\ntopics like \"money laundering\" while recovering 5-20% of target conversations.\nThis industry-wide vulnerability poses significant risks for users under\nnetwork surveillance by ISPs, governments, or local adversaries. We evaluate\nthree mitigation strategies - random padding, token batching, and packet\ninjection - finding that while each reduces attack effectiveness, none provides\ncomplete protection. Through responsible disclosure, we have collaborated with\nproviders to implement initial countermeasures. Our findings underscore the\nneed for LLM providers to address metadata leakage as AI systems handle\nincreasingly sensitive information."}

We argue that parametric recalibration\nfunctions based on logistic regression can be motivated from a simple\ntheoretical setting for both binary and multiclass classification. This insight\nmotivates the use of more expressive calibration methods beyond standard\ntemperature scaling. For multi-class calibration however, a key challenge lies\nin the increasing number of parameters introduced by more complex models, often\ncoupled with limited calibration data, which can lead to overfitting. Through\nextensive experiments, we demonstrate that the resulting bias-variance tradeoff\ncan be effectively managed by structured regularization, robust preprocessing\nand efficient optimization. The resulting methods lead to substantial gains\nover existing logistic-based calibration techniques. We provide efficient and\neasy-to-use open-source implementations of our methods, making them an\nattractive alternative to common temperature, vector, and matrix scaling\nimplementations."}

In this paper, we present the OpenHands Software Agent\nSDK, a toolkit for implementing software development agents that satisfy these\ndesiderata. This toolkit is a complete architectural redesign of the agent\ncomponents of the popular OpenHands framework for software development agents,\nwhich has 64k+ GitHub stars. To achieve flexibility, we design a simple\ninterface for implementing agents that requires only a few lines of code in the\ndefault case, but is easily extensible to more complex, full-featured agents\nwith features such as custom tools, memory management, and more. For security\nand reliability, it delivers seamless local-to-remote execution portability,\nintegrated REST/WebSocket services. For interaction with human users, it can\nconnect directly to a variety of interfaces, such as visual workspaces (VS\nCode, VNC, browser), command-line interfaces, and APIs. Compared with existing\nSDKs from OpenAI, Claude, and Google, OpenHands uniquely integrates native\nsandboxed execution, lifecycle control, model-agnostic multi-LLM routing, and\nbuilt-in security analysis. Empirical results on SWE-Bench Verified and GAIA\nbenchmarks demonstrate strong performance. Put together, these elements allow\nthe OpenHands Software Agent SDK to provide a practical foundation for\nprototyping, unlocking new classes of custom applications, and reliably\ndeploying agents at scale."}

Their design, however, remains a largely handcrafted process,\nresulting in long and error-prone design cycles. While the recent rise of\nAI-based reinforcement learning and generative AI has created new techniques to\nautomate this task, the need for many time-consuming simulations is a critical\nbottleneck hindering the overall efficiency. Furthermore, the lack of\nexplainability of the resulting design solutions hampers widespread adoption of\nthe tools. To address these issues, a novel agentic AI framework for\nsample-efficient and explainable analog circuit sizing is presented. It employs\na multi-agent workflow where specialized Large Language Model (LLM)-based\nagents collaborate to interpret the circuit topology, to understand the design\ngoals, and to iteratively refine the circuit's design parameters towards the\ntarget goals with human-interpretable reasoning. The adaptive simulation\nstrategy creates an intelligent control that yields a high sample efficiency.\nThe AnaFlow framework is demonstrated for two circuits of varying complexity\nand is able to complete the sizing task fully automatically, differently from\npure Bayesian optimization and reinforcement learning approaches. The system\nlearns from its optimization history to avoid past mistakes and to accelerate\nconvergence. The inherent explainability makes this a powerful tool for analog\ndesign space exploration and a new paradigm in analog EDA, where AI agents\nserve as transparent design assistants."}

Using a scheme-constrained LLM annotation pipeline, we obtain 13k\nannotated reference expressions with reliability estimates and analyze the\nresulting understanding states.
