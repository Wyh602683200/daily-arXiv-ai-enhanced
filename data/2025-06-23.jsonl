Unlike traditional Large Language\nModels (LLMs), VLMs face unique vulnerabilities due to their multimodal nature,\nallowing adversaries to modify visual or textual inputs to bypass safety\nguardrails and trigger the generation of harmful content. Through systematic\nanalysis of VLM behavior under attack, we identify a novel phenomenon termed\n``delayed safety awareness''. Specifically, we observe that safety-aligned VLMs\nmay initially be compromised to produce harmful content, but eventually\nrecognize the associated risks and attempt to self-correct. This pattern\nsuggests that VLMs retain their underlying safety awareness but experience a\ntemporal delay in their activation. Building on this insight, we hypothesize\nthat VLMs' safety awareness can be proactively reactivated through carefully\ndesigned prompts. To this end, we introduce ``The Safety Reminder'', a soft\nprompt tuning approach that optimizes learnable prompt tokens, which are\nperiodically injected during the text generation process to enhance safety\nawareness, effectively preventing harmful content generation. Additionally, our\nsafety reminder only activates when harmful content is detected, leaving normal\nconversations unaffected and preserving the model's performance on benign\ntasks. Through comprehensive evaluation across three established safety\nbenchmarks and one adversarial attacks, we demonstrate that our approach\nsignificantly reduces attack success rates while maintaining model utility,\noffering a practical solution for deploying safer VLMs in real-world\napplications."}

While substantial efforts have been made to\nimprove their robustness, existing defenses often rely on costly fine-tuning of\nmodel parameters or employ suboptimal heuristic techniques. In this work, we\ntake a novel approach to safeguard LLMs by learning to adapt the system prompts\nin instruction-tuned LLMs. While LLMs are typically pre-trained to follow a\nfixed system prompt, we investigate the impact of tailoring the system prompt\nto each specific user input on the safety of the responses.

To build this understanding, we first introduce a\ntheoretical model which we call a \\textit{thought Markov decision process}\n(MDP). Thought MDPs minimally extend the classical MDP model to include an\nabstract notion of thought state and thought action. Using the thought MDP\nmodel, we prove the importance of policy initialization in determining whether\nor not thinking emerges and show formally that thought actions are equivalent\nto the agent choosing to perform a step of policy improvement before continuing\nto act. We then show that open-source LLMs satisfy the conditions that our\ntheory predicts are necessary for model-free RL to produce thinking-like\nbehavior. Finally, we hypothesize sufficient conditions that would enable\nthinking to be learned outside of language generation and introduce a toy\ndomain where a combination of multi-task pre-training and designated thought\nactions enable more data-efficient RL compared to non-thinking agents."}

However, due to the network dynamics and varying\ninformation gathering latencies, it is extremely challenging to observe and\ncollect all trust attributes of a collaborating device concurrently for a\ncomprehensive trust assessment. In this paper, a novel progressive trust\nevaluation framework, namely chain-of-trust, is proposed to make better use of\nmisaligned device attribute data. This framework, designed for effective task\ncompletion, divides the trust evaluation process into multiple chained stages\nbased on task decomposition. At each stage, based on the task completion\nprocess, the framework only gathers the latest device attribute data relevant\nto that stage, leading to reduced trust evaluation complexity and overhead. By\nleveraging advanced in-context learning, few-shot learning, and reasoning\ncapabilities, generative AI is then employed to analyze and interpret the\ncollected data to produce correct evaluation results quickly. Only devices\ndeemed trustworthy at this stage proceed to the next round of trust evaluation.\nThe framework ultimately determines devices that remain trustworthy across all\nstages.

However, beyond subgraph frequency estimation, their\napplication to network motif significance-profile (SP) prediction remains\nunder-explored, with no established benchmarks in the literature. We propose to\naddress this problem, framing SP estimation as a task independent of subgraph\nfrequency estimation. Our approach shifts from frequency counting to direct SP\nestimation and modulates the problem as multitarget regression. The\nreformulation is optimised for interpretability, stability and scalability on\nlarge graphs. We validate our method using a large synthetic dataset and\nfurther test it on real-world graphs. Our experiments reveal that 1-WL limited\nmodels struggle to make precise estimations of SPs. However, they can\ngeneralise to approximate the graph generation processes of networks by\ncomparing their predicted SP with the ones originating from synthetic\ngenerators. This first study on GNN-based motif estimation also hints at how\nusing direct SP estimation can help go past the theoretical limitations that\nmotif estimation faces when performed through subgraph counting."}

However, applying RL at scale\nremains intimidatingly resource-intensive, requiring multiple model copies and\nextensive GPU workloads. On the other hand, while being powerful, recent\nstudies suggest that RL does not fundamentally endow models with new knowledge;\nrather, it primarily reshapes the model's output distribution to activate\nreasoning capabilities latent in the base model. Building on this insight, we\nhypothesize that the changes in output probabilities induced by RL are largely\nmodel-size invariant, opening the door to a more efficient paradigm: training a\nsmall model with RL and transferring its induced probability shifts to larger\nbase models. To verify our hypothesis, we conduct a token-level analysis of\ndecoding trajectories and find high alignment in RL-induced output\ndistributions across model scales, validating our hypothesis. Motivated by\nthis, we propose RAST, a simple yet effective method that transfers reasoning\nbehaviors by injecting RL-induced probability adjustments from a small\nRL-trained model into larger models. Experiments across multiple mathematical\nreasoning benchmarks show that RAST substantially and consistently enhances the\nreasoning capabilities of base models while requiring significantly lower GPU\nmemory than direct RL training, sometimes even yielding better performance than\nthe RL-trained counterparts.

Nav-Q\nmodule processes the fused quantum states through variational quantum circuits\nto learn optimal navigation policies under swift dynamic and complex\nconditions. Finally, post quantum cryptographic protocols are used to secure\ncommunication channels for both within vehicle communication and V2X (Vehicle\nto Everything) communications and thus secures the autonomous vehicle\ncommunication from both classical and quantum security threats. Thus, the\nproposed framework addresses fundamental challenges in autonomous vehicles\nnavigation by providing quantum performance and future proof security.

We\nintroduce AutoHFormer, a hierarchical autoregressive transformer that addresses\nthese challenges through three key innovations: 1) Hierarchical Temporal\nModeling: Our architecture decomposes predictions into segment-level blocks\nprocessed in parallel, followed by intra-segment sequential refinement. This\ndual-scale approach maintains temporal coherence while enabling efficient\ncomputation. 2) Dynamic Windowed Attention: The attention mechanism employs\nlearnable causal windows with exponential decay, reducing complexity while\npreserving precise temporal relationships. This design avoids both the\nanti-causal violations of standard transformers and the sequential bottlenecks\nof RNN hybrids. 3) Adaptive Temporal Encoding: a novel position encoding system\nis adopted to capture time patterns at multiple scales. It combines fixed\noscillating patterns for short-term variations with learnable decay rates for\nlong-term trends. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate that AutoHFormer 10.76X\nfaster training and 6.06X memory reduction compared to PatchTST on PEMS08,\nwhile maintaining consistent accuracy across 96-720 step horizons in most of\ncases.

Consequently, small shifts in hidden\nactivations can re-trigger harmful behaviors embedded in the latent space. To\nexplore the robustness of safety alignment to latent perturbations, we\nintroduce a probing method that measures the Negative Log-Likelihood of the\noriginal response generated by the model. This probe quantifies local\nsensitivity in the latent space, serving as a diagnostic tool for identifying\nvulnerable directions. Based on this signal, we construct effective jailbreak\ntrajectories, giving rise to the Activation Steering Attack (ASA).

An LLM with a strong world model should attribute most of the\nvariability in its responses to changes in foundational purpose rather than\nsuperficial changes in articulation. This approach allows us to quantify how\nmuch of a model's behavior is semantically grounded rather than driven by model\ninstability or alternative wording.

Moreover, multi-modal side\ninformation of items, such as descriptive text and images, geographical\nknowledge in location-based recommendation services, has been shown to be\neffective in improving recommendations by providing richer contexts for\ninteractions. Nevertheless, effectively integrating such complementary\nknowledge into existing generative recommendation frameworks remains\nchallenging. To overcome these challenges, we propose a novel unsupervised deep\nquantization exclusively based on contrastive learning, named SimCIT (a Simple\nContrastive Item Tokenization framework). Specifically, different from existing\nreconstruction-based strategies, SimCIT propose to use a learnable residual\nquantization module to align with the signals from different modalities of the\nitems, which combines multi-modal knowledge alignment and semantic tokenization\nin a mutually beneficial contrastive learning framework. Extensive experiments\nacross public datasets and a large-scale industrial dataset from various\ndomains demonstrate SimCIT's effectiveness in LLM-based generative\nrecommendation."}

But why, in the first place, is unfairness in ML morally wrong? And\nwhy should we care about improving fairness? Most fair-ML research implicitly\nappeals to distributive equality: the idea that desirable goods and benefits,\nsuch as opportunities (e.g., Barocas et al., 2023), should be equally\ndistributed across society. Unfair ML models, then, are seen as wrong because\nthey unequally distribute such benefits. This paper argues that this exclusive\nfocus on distributive equality offers an incomplete and potentially misleading\nethical foundation. Grounding ML fairness in egalitarianism -- the view that\nequality is a fundamental moral and social ideal -- requires challenging\nstructural inequality: systematic, institutional, and durable arrangements that\nprivilege some groups while disadvantaging others. Structural inequality\nmanifests through ML systems in two primary forms: allocative harms (e.g.,\neconomic loss) and representational harms (e.g., stereotypes, erasure). While\ndistributive equality helps address allocative harms, it fails to explain why\nrepresentational harms are wrong -- why it is wrong for ML systems to reinforce\nsocial hierarchies that stratify people into superior and inferior groups --\nand why ML systems should aim to foster a society where people relate as equals\n(i.e., relational equality). To address these limitations, the paper proposes a\nmultifaceted egalitarian framework for ML fairness that integrates both\ndistributive and relational equality. Drawing on critical social and political\nphilosophy, this framework offers a more comprehensive ethical foundation for\ntackling the full spectrum of harms perpetuated by ML systems.

Many\nsuch time series exhibit multiple regimes, i.e., consecutive temporal segments\nwith a priori unknown boundaries, with each regime having its own causal\nstructure. Inferring causal dependencies and regime shifts is critical for\nanalyzing the underlying processes. However, causal structure learning in this\nsetting is challenging due to (1) non stationarity, i.e., each regime can have\nits own causal graph and mixing function, and (2) complex noise distributions,\nwhich may be non Gaussian or heteroscedastic. Existing causal discovery\napproaches cannot address these challenges, since generally assume stationarity\nor Gaussian noise with constant variance. Hence, we introduce FANTOM, a unified\nframework for causal discovery that handles non stationary processes along with\nnon Gaussian and heteroscedastic noises. FANTOM simultaneously infers the\nnumber of regimes and their corresponding indices and learns each regime's\nDirected Acyclic Graph. It uses a Bayesian Expectation Maximization algorithm\nthat maximizes the evidence lower bound of the data log likelihood.

Inspired by the way humans reason with mental\nimagery-the internal construction and manipulation of visual cues-we\ninvestigate whether VLMs can reason through interleaved multimodal trajectories\nwithout producing explicit images. To this end, we present a Machine Mental\nImagery framework, dubbed as Mirage, which augments VLM decoding with latent\nvisual tokens alongside ordinary text. Concretely, whenever the model chooses\nto ``think visually'', it recasts its hidden states as next tokens, thereby\ncontinuing a multimodal trajectory without generating pixel-level images. Begin\nby supervising the latent tokens through distillation from ground-truth image\nembeddings, we then switch to text-only supervision to make the latent\ntrajectory align tightly with the task objective. A subsequent reinforcement\nlearning stage further enhances the multimodal reasoning capability.\nExperiments on diverse benchmarks demonstrate that Mirage unlocks stronger\nmultimodal reasoning without explicit image generation."}

Approaches like\nReinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) and Reinforcement Learning\nwith Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) have shown strong results, but they require\nextensive external supervision. We investigate an alternative class of methods,\nReinforcement Learning from Internal Feedback (RLIF), which relies solely on\nintrinsic model-derived signals instead of external rewards. In particular, we\nleverage unsupervised reward proxies such as token-level entropy,\ntrajectory-level entropy, and self-certainty. Our theoretical analysis shows\nthese internal objectives are partially equivalent, and we empirically evaluate\nvarious RLIF strategies on challenging math reasoning benchmarks. Experimental\nresults demonstrate that RLIF can boost the reasoning performance of base LLMs\nat the beginning phase of the training, matching or surpassing RLVR techniques\non these tasks. However, when training progresses, performance degrades even\nbelow the model before training. Moreover, we find that RLIF yields little\nimprovement for instruction-tuned models, indicating diminishing returns of\nintrinsic feedback once an LLM is already instruction-tuned. We further analyze\nthis limitation by mixing model weights and explain the reason of RLIF's\ntraining behaviors, providing practical guidelines for integrating internal\nfeedback signals into LLM training. We hope our analysis of internal feedback\nwill inform more principled and effective strategies for LLM post-training."}
