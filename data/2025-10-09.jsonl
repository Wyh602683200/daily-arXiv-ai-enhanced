Yet, unlike learning, where generalization and out of\ndistribution (OoD) evaluation concepts are well formalized, there is no clear,\nconsistent definition or metric for reasoning ability. We propose Complexity\nOut of Distribution (Complexity OoD) generalization as a framework and problem\nsetting to define and measure reasoning. A model exhibits Complexity OoD\ngeneralization when it maintains performance on test instances whose minimal\nrequired solution complexity, either representational (richer solution\nstructure) or computational (more reasoning steps/program length), exceeds that\nof all training examples. We formalize complexity via solution description\nKolmogorov complexity and operational proxies (e.g., object/relation counts;\nreasoning step counts), clarifying how Complexity OoD differs from length and\ncompositional OoD. This lens unifies learning and reasoning: many cases\nsolvable with System1 like processing at low complexity become System2 like\nunder complexity pressure, while System2 can be viewed as generalization over\nsolution structures. We translate this perspective into practice with\nrecommendations for operationalizing Complexity OoD across the stack:\nincorporating complexity into benchmark and evaluation metric design,\nrethinking supervision to target solution traces, seeking and designing\ninductive biases for Complexity OoD generalization, addressing learning to\nreason spillovers such as spurious shortcuts, semantic robustness, catastrophic\nforgetting, and step wise calibration.

In this work, we introduce BuilderBench, a benchmark to\naccelerate research into agent pre-training that centers open-ended\nexploration. BuilderBench requires agents to learn how to build any structure\nusing blocks. BuilderBench is equipped with $(1)$ a hardware accelerated\nsimulator of a robotic agent interacting with various physical blocks, and\n$(2)$ a task-suite with over 42 diverse target structures that are carefully\ncurated to test an understanding of physics, mathematics, and long-horizon\nplanning.

A key prerequisite, however, is the ability to assess the\nusefulness and build on another model's partial thinking -- we call this\noff-trajectory reasoning. Our paper investigates a critical question: can\nstandard solo-reasoning training pipelines deliver desired off-trajectory\nbehaviors? We propose twin tests that capture the two extremes of the\noff-trajectory spectrum, namely Recoverability, which tests whether LLMs can\nbacktrack from \"distractions\" induced by misleading reasoning traces, and\nGuidability, which tests their ability to build upon correct reasoning from\nstronger collaborators. Our study evaluates 15 open-weight LLMs (1.5B-32B) and\nreveals a counterintuitive finding -- \"stronger\" LLMs on benchmarks are often\nmore fragile under distraction. Moreover, all models tested fail to effectively\nleverage guiding steps from collaborators on problems beyond their inherent\ncapabilities with solve rates remaining under 9.2%. Finally, we conduct control\nstudies to isolate the effects of three factors in post-training on these\nbehaviors: the choice of distillation teacher, the use of RL, and data\nselection strategy.

In this paper, we propose a\nreasoning-driven LLM-based pipeline to study effective reasoning behavior\npatterns in agentic search. Using this pipeline, we analyze successful agentic\nsearch trajectories and identify four beneficial reasoning behaviors:\nInformation Verification, Authority Evaluation, Adaptive Search, and Error\nRecovery. Based on these findings, we propose a technique called Behavior\nPriming to train more effective agentic search models. It synthesizes agentic\nsearch trajectories that exhibit these four behaviors and integrates them into\nthe agentic search model through supervised fine-tuning (SFT), followed by\nstandard reinforcement learning (RL). Experiments on three benchmarks (GAIA,\nWebWalker, and HLE) demonstrate that behavior priming yields over 35% gains in\nLlama3.2-3B and Qwen3-1.7B compared to directly training agentic search models\nwith RL. Crucially, we demonstrate that the desired reasoning behaviors in the\nSFT data, rather than the correctness of the final answer, is the critical\nfactor for achieving strong final performance after RL: fine-tuning on\ntrajectories with desirable reasoning behaviors but incorrect answers leads to\nbetter performance than fine-tuning on trajectories with correct answers.

To\naddress these critical gaps, we introduce NewtonBench, a benchmark comprising\n324 scientific law discovery tasks across 12 physics domains.

We conducted semi-structured\ninterviews with 13 developers, all early adopters of multi-agent Gen AI\ntechnology who work at Microsoft. Our findings revealed that these early\nadopters conceptualize multi-agent systems as \"teams\" of specialized role-based\nand task-based agents, such as assistants or reviewers, structured similar to\nhuman collaboration models and ranging from AI-dominant to AI-assisted,\nuser-controlled interactions. We identified key challenges, including error\npropagation, unpredictable and unproductive agent loop behavior, and the need\nfor clear communication to mitigate the layered transparency issues. Early\nadopters' perspectives about the role of transparency underscored its\nimportance as a way to build trust, verify and trace errors, and prevent\nmisuse, errors, and leaks. The insights and design considerations we present\ncontribute to CSCW research about collaborative mechanisms with capabilities\nranging from AI-dominant to AI-assisted interactions, transparency and\noversight strategies in human-agent and agent-agent interactions, and how\nhumans make sense of these multi-agent systems as dynamic, role-diverse\ncollaborators which are customizable for diverse needs and workflows. We\nconclude with future research directions that extend CSCW approaches to the\ndesign of inter-agent and human mediation interactions."}

In contrast to\nLLM planning, symbolic planning methods offer strong reliability and\nrepeatability guarantees, but struggle to scale to the complexity and ambiguity\nof real-world tasks. We introduce a new robotic planning method that augments\nLLM planners with symbolic planning oversight to improve reliability and\nrepeatability, and provide a transparent approach to defining hard constraints\nwith considerably stronger clarity than traditional prompt engineering.\nImportantly, these augmentations preserve the reasoning capabilities of LLMs\nand retain impressive generalization in open-world environments. We demonstrate\nour approach in simulated and real-world environments. On the ALFWorld planning\nbenchmark, our approach outperforms current state-of-the-art methods, achieving\na near-perfect 99% success rate. Deployment of our method to a real-world\nquadruped robot resulted in 100% task success compared to 50% and 30% for pure\nLLM and symbolic planners across embodied pick and place tasks. Our approach\npresents an effective strategy to enhance the reliability, repeatability and\ntransparency of LLM-based robot planners while retaining their key strengths:\nflexibility and generalizability to complex real-world environments.

While many studies have demonstrated\nperformance benefits of combining multiple model predictions, existing\nstrategies using linear pooling methods (ranging from simple averaging to\ndynamic weight updates) face a key limitation. Dynamic prediction combinations\nthat rely on historical performance to update weights are necessarily reactive.\nDue to the need to average over a reasonable number of epochs (with moving\naverages or exponential weighting), they tend to be slow to adjust to changing\ncircumstances (phase or regime changes). In this work, we develop a model that\nuses machine learning to forecast the performance of predictions by models at\neach epoch in a time series. This enables `context-awareness' by assigning\nhigher weight to models that are likely to be more accurate at a given time. We\nshow that adding a performance forecasting worker in a decentralized learning\nnetwork, following a design similar to the Allora network, can improve the\naccuracy of network inferences. Specifically, we find forecasting models that\npredict regret (performance relative to the network inference) or regret\nz-score (performance relative to other workers) show greater improvement than\nmodels predicting losses, which often do not outperform the naive network\ninference (historically weighted average of all inferences). Through a series\nof optimization tests, we show that the performance of the forecasting model\ncan be sensitive to choices in the feature set and number of training epochs.\nThese properties may depend on the exact problem and should be tailored to each\ndomain.

Prompts for LLMs generally comprise two components:\nthe \\textit{instruction}, which defines the task or objective, and the\n\\textit{input}, which is tailored to the instruction type. In natural language\ngeneration (NLG) tasks such as machine translation, the \\textit{input}\ncomponent is particularly critical, while the \\textit{instruction} component\ntends to be concise. Existing prompt engineering methods primarily focus on\noptimizing the \\textit{instruction} component for general tasks, often\nrequiring large-parameter LLMs as auxiliary tools. However, these approaches\nexhibit limited applicability for tasks like machine translation, where the\n\\textit{input} component plays a more pivotal role. To address this limitation,\nthis paper introduces a novel prompt optimization method specifically designed\nfor machine translation tasks.

The tool accepts a CSV file\ncontaining paper titles and abstracts. Users specify inclusion and exclusion\ncriteria. One can use multiple LLMs for screening via OpenRouter. AiSysRev\nsupports both zero-shot and few-shot screening, and also allows for manual\nscreening through interfaces that display LLM results as guidance for human\nreviewers.We conducted a trial study with 137 papers using the tool. Our\nfindings indicate that papers can be classified into four categories: Easy\nIncludes, Easy Excludes, Boundary Includes, and Boundary Excludes.
