From a task-centric perspective, existing KGR\napproaches can be broadly classified into static single-step KGR, static\nmulti-step KGR, dynamic KGR, multi-modal KGR, few-shot KGR, and inductive KGR.\nWhile existing surveys have covered these six types of KGR tasks, a\ncomprehensive review that systematically summarizes all KGR tasks particularly\nincluding downstream applications and more challenging reasoning paradigms\nremains lacking. In contrast to previous works, this survey provides a more\ncomprehensive perspective on the research of KGR by categorizing approaches\nbased on primary reasoning tasks, downstream application tasks, and potential\nchallenging reasoning tasks.

In contrast, federated learning (FL) offers a\ndistributed alternative without the need to share data. Recently, for the\ngrowing demand for personalizing AI models for different user purposes,\npersonalized federated learning (PFL) has emerged. PFL allows each client to\nleverage the knowledge of other clients for further adaptation to individual\nuser preferences, again without the need to share data. Despite its potential,\nmost PFL studies remain confined to simulated environments, overlooking the\ndata and model heterogeneity that arise in real-world scenarios. In contrast,\nwe first consider large data heterogeneity, evaluating on a new benchmark for\nmulti-modal PFL, spanning 40 distinct tasks with realistic data distribution\nshifts. We then consider model heterogeneity in that we do not assume that all\nclients share similar model architectures. To address data heterogeneity, we\npropose a task-similarity-aware model aggregation method that provides\ncustomized global models to each client. For model heterogeneity, we propose a\ndimension-invariant module that enables knowledge sharing across heterogeneous\nmodels. Empirical validations demonstrate that the proposed approach\noutperforms the state-of-the-art, excelling in both personalization and\ngeneralization capabilities."}

Our motivation is to uncover this\nblueprint. We introduce a generative model, to learn this underlying\nrepresentation from detailed connectivity maps of mouse cortical microcircuits.\nOur model successfully captures the essential structural information of these\ncircuits in a compressed latent space.

This\nraises a central question: How does the position of retrieved evidence affect\nmultimodal RAG performance? To answer this, we present the first comprehensive\nstudy of position bias in multimodal RAG systems. Through controlled\nexperiments across text-only, image-only, and mixed-modality tasks, we observe\na consistent U-shaped accuracy curve with respect to evidence position. To\nquantify this bias, we introduce the Position Sensitivity Index ($PSI_p$) and\ndevelop a visualization framework to trace attention allocation patterns across\ndecoder layers.

While most\nstudies have concentrated on immediate bias in static contexts, this paper\nhighlights the importance of investigating long-term fairness in dynamic\ndecision-making systems while simultaneously considering instantaneous fairness\nrequirements. In the context of reinforcement learning, we propose a general\nframework where long-term fairness is measured by the difference in the average\nexpected qualification gain that individuals from different groups could\nobtain.Then, through a causal lens, we decompose this metric into three\ncomponents that represent the direct impact, the delayed impact, as well as the\nspurious effect the policy has on the qualification gain. We analyze the\nintrinsic connection between these components and an emerging fairness notion\ncalled benefit fairness that aims to control the equity of outcomes in\ndecision-making. Finally, we develop a simple yet effective approach for\nbalancing various fairness notions."}

These settings,\ncharacterized by multi-step, complex problem solving, lead to high failure\nrates even for frontier LLMs, as the reward landscape is too sparse for\neffective model training via conventional RLVR. In this work, we introduce\nAgent-RLVR, a framework that makes RLVR effective in challenging agentic\nsettings, with an initial focus on software engineering tasks. Inspired by\nhuman pedagogy, Agent-RLVR introduces agent guidance, a mechanism that actively\nsteers the agent towards successful trajectories by leveraging diverse\ninformational cues. These cues, ranging from high-level strategic plans to\ndynamic feedback on the agent's errors and environmental interactions, emulate\na teacher's guidance, enabling the agent to navigate difficult solution spaces\nand promotes active self-improvement via additional environment exploration. In\nthe Agent-RLVR training loop, agents first attempt to solve tasks to produce\ninitial trajectories, which are then validated by unit tests and supplemented\nwith agent guidance. Agents then reattempt with guidance, and the agent policy\nis updated with RLVR based on the rewards of these guided trajectories.\nAgent-RLVR elevates the pass@1 performance of Qwen-2.5-72B-Instruct from 9.4%\nto 22.4% on SWE-Bench Verified. We find that our guidance-augmented RLVR data\nis additionally useful for test-time reward model training, shown by further\nboosting pass@1 to 27.8%. Agent-RLVR lays the groundwork for training agents\nwith RLVR in complex, real-world environments where conventional RL methods\nstruggle."}

Moreover, the ego-vehicle employs a longitudinal braking\naction to ensure the safety of both itself and the surrounding vehicles. Our\narchitecture consists of two modules: (i) a perception module that senses the\nenvironment, derives input numerical features, and converts them into\nlinguistic categories; and communicates them to the prediction module; (ii) a\npretrained prediction module that executes a KGE and Bayesian inference model\nto anticipate the target vehicle's maneuver and transforms the prediction into\nlongitudinal braking action. Real-world hardware experimental validation\ndemonstrates that our prediction system anticipates the target vehicle's lane\nchange three to four seconds in advance, providing the ego vehicle sufficient\ntime to react and allowing the target vehicle to make the lane change safely."}

Drawing on knowledge from a group of\nmedalists in international algorithmic contests, we revisit this claim,\nexamining how LLMs differ from human experts and where limitations still\nremain. We introduce LiveCodeBench Pro, a benchmark composed of problems from\nCodeforces, ICPC, and IOI that are continuously updated to reduce the\nlikelihood of data contamination. A team of Olympiad medalists annotates every\nproblem for algorithmic categories and conducts a line-by-line analysis of\nfailed model-generated submissions. Using this new data and benchmark, we find\nthat frontier models still have significant limitations: without external\ntools, the best model achieves only 53% pass@1 on medium-difficulty problems\nand 0% on hard problems, domains where expert humans still excel. We also find\nthat LLMs succeed at implementation-heavy problems but struggle with nuanced\nalgorithmic reasoning and complex case analysis, often generating confidently\nincorrect justifications. High performance appears largely driven by\nimplementation precision and tool augmentation, not superior reasoning.\nLiveCodeBench Pro thus highlights the significant gap to human grandmaster\nlevels, while offering fine-grained diagnostics to steer future improvements in\ncode-centric LLM reasoning."}

When tested on the field, one can only use the labels available at\nthe time of training and testing (e.g. seen and assumed negatives). As\nvulnerabilities are discovered across calendar time, labels change and past\nperformance is not necessarily aligned with future performance. Past works only\nconsidered the slices of the whole history (e.g. DiverseVUl) or individual\ndifferences between releases (e.g. Jimenez et al. ESEC/FSE 2019). Such\napproaches are either too optimistic in training (e.g. the whole history) or\ntoo conservative (e.g. consecutive releases). We propose a method to\nrestructure a dataset into a series of datasets in which both training and\ntesting labels change to account for the knowledge available at the time. If\nthe model is actually learning, it should improve its performance over time as\nmore data becomes available and data becomes more stable, an effect that can be\nchecked with the Mann-Kendall test. We validate our methodology for\nvulnerability detection with 4 time-based datasets (3 projects from BigVul\ndataset + Vuldeepecker's NVD) and 5 ML models (Code2Vec, CodeBERT, LineVul,\nReGVD, and Vuldeepecker).
