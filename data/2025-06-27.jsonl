Specifically, LLMs are only capable of performing\nshallow (level-1) causal reasoning, primarily attributed to the causal\nknowledge embedded in their parameters, but they lack the capacity for genuine\nhuman-like (level-2) causal reasoning. To support this hypothesis,\nmethodologically, we delve into the autoregression mechanism of\ntransformer-based LLMs, revealing that it is not inherently causal.\nEmpirically, we introduce a new causal Q&A benchmark called CausalProbe-2024,\nwhose corpora are fresh and nearly unseen for the studied LLMs. The LLMs\nexhibit a significant performance drop on CausalProbe-2024 compared to earlier\nbenchmarks, indicating the fact that they primarily engage in level-1 causal\nreasoning. To bridge the gap towards level-2 causal reasoning, we draw\ninspiration from the fact that human reasoning is usually facilitated by\ngeneral knowledge and intended goals.

However, we show that speculation is\nineffective for MoEs: draft tokens collectively activate more weights,\nincreasing data movement and verification time by 2-3x. When token throughput\ngains fail to offset this overhead, speculation causes slowdowns up to 1.5x,\nmaking it infeasible. Even when useful, the optimal K varies by task, model,\nand even between requests and iterations. Thus, despite widespread use in dense\nLLMs, speculation remains impractical in leading MoEs.\n  We present Cascade, a utility-driven framework that selectively enables\nspeculation to avoid slowdowns and dynamically tunes K to accelerate MoE\nserving. Cascade uses a lightweight metric, speculation utility, the ratio of\ntoken gains to verification cost, which shows iteration-level locality,\nenabling periodic decisions via short test and longer set phases. For each\nrequest, Cascade disables speculation if utility drops below one during\ntesting, and when utility exceeds one, tests multiple K-values to choose the\nutility-maximizing K for the set phase. We implement Cascade in vLLM and\nevaluate it on five popular MoEs with workloads spanning code, math,\nextraction, and mixed tasks. Cascade limits slowdown to 5% (vs. 1.5x) and\nimproves throughput by 7-14% over static K, making speculative decoding\npractical for MoEs."}

To\nbridge this gap, we propose PTACL (Patient and Temporal Alignment Contrastive\nLearning), a multimodal contrastive learning framework that enhances ECG\nrepresentations by integrating spatio-temporal information from CMR. PTACL uses\nglobal patient-level contrastive loss and local temporal-level contrastive\nloss. The global loss aligns patient-level representations by pulling ECG and\nCMR embeddings from the same patient closer together, while pushing apart\nembeddings from different patients. Local loss enforces fine-grained temporal\nalignment within each patient by contrasting encoded ECG segments with\ncorresponding encoded CMR frames. This approach enriches ECG representations\nwith diagnostic information beyond electrical activity and transfers more\ninsights between modalities than global alignment alone, all without\nintroducing new learnable weights. We evaluate PTACL on paired ECG-CMR data\nfrom 27,951 subjects in the UK Biobank.

On\nthe other hand, diffusion models generate a diverse set of SR images, but\nselecting the most trustworthy solution from this set remains a challenge. This\npaper introduces a robust, automated framework for identifying the most\ntrustworthy SR sample from a diffusion-generated set by leveraging the semantic\nreasoning capabilities of vision-language models (VLMs). Specifically, VLMs\nsuch as BLIP-2, GPT-4o, and their variants are prompted with structured queries\nto assess semantic correctness, visual quality, and artifact presence. The\ntop-ranked SR candidates are then ensembled to yield a single trustworthy\noutput in a cost-effective manner. To rigorously assess the validity of\nVLM-selected samples, we propose a novel Trustworthiness Score (TWS) a hybrid\nmetric that quantifies SR reliability based on three complementary components:\nsemantic similarity via CLIP embeddings, structural integrity using SSIM on\nedge maps, and artifact sensitivity through multi-level wavelet decomposition.\nWe empirically show that TWS correlates strongly with human preference in both\nambiguous and natural images, and that VLM-guided selections consistently yield\nhigh TWS values. Compared to conventional metrics like PSNR, LPIPS, which fail\nto reflect information fidelity, our approach offers a principled, scalable,\nand generalizable solution for navigating the uncertainty of the diffusion SR\nspace.

However, existing methods struggle\nwith achieving a realistic and seamless transformation across the entire\nlifespan, especially when handling large age gaps or extreme head poses. The\ncore challenge lies in balancing age accuracy and identity preservation--what\nwe refer to as the Age-ID trade-off. Most prior methods either prioritize age\ntransformation at the expense of identity consistency or vice versa. In this\nwork, we address this issue by proposing a two-pass face aging framework, named\nCradle2Cane, based on few-step text-to-image (T2I) diffusion models. The first\npass focuses on solving age accuracy by introducing an adaptive noise injection\n(AdaNI) mechanism. This mechanism is guided by including prompt descriptions of\nage and gender for the given person as the textual condition. Also, by\nadjusting the noise level, we can control the strength of aging while allowing\nmore flexibility in transforming the face. However, identity preservation is\nweakly ensured here to facilitate stronger age transformations. In the second\npass, we enhance identity preservation while maintaining age-specific features\nby conditioning the model on two identity-aware embeddings (IDEmb): SVR-ArcFace\nand Rotate-CLIP. This pass allows for denoising the transformed image from the\nfirst pass, ensuring stronger identity preservation without compromising the\naging accuracy. Both passes are jointly trained in an end-to-end way. Extensive\nexperiments on the CelebA-HQ test dataset, evaluated through Face++ and Qwen-VL\nprotocols, show that our Cradle2Cane outperforms existing face aging methods in\nage accuracy and identity consistency."}

Capturing node heterophily in heterogeneous graphs is very\nchallenging since both node/edge heterogeneity and node heterophily should be\ncarefully taken into consideration. Existing methods typically convert\nheterogeneous graphs into homogeneous ones to learn node heterophily, which\nwill inevitably lose the potential heterophily conveyed by heterogeneous\nrelations.

There is also a growing expectation for them\nto display human-like personalities during interactions. To meet this\nexpectation, numerous studies have proposed methods for modelling LLM\npersonalities through psychometric evaluations. However, most existing models\nface two major limitations: they rely on the Big Five (OCEAN) framework, which\nonly provides coarse personality dimensions, and they lack mechanisms for\ncontrolling trait intensity. In this paper, we address this gap by extending\nthe Machine Personality Inventory (MPI), which originally used the Big Five\nmodel, to incorporate the 16 Personality Factor (16PF) model, allowing\nexpressive control over sixteen distinct traits. We also developed a structured\nframework known as Specific Attribute Control (SAC) for evaluating and\ndynamically inducing trait intensity in LLMs. Our method introduces\nadjective-based semantic anchoring to guide trait intensity expression and\nleverages behavioural questions across five intensity factors:\n\\textit{Frequency}, \\textit{Depth}, \\textit{Threshold}, \\textit{Effort}, and\n\\textit{Willingness}.

To create this benchmark, we curated\nnew, original datasets tailored for Slovak and meticulously translated\nestablished English NLU resources. Within this paper, we also present the first\nsystematic and extensive evaluation of a wide array of Slovak-specific,\nmultilingual, and English pre-trained language models using the skLEP tasks.\nFinally, we also release the complete benchmark data, an open-source toolkit\nfacilitating both fine-tuning and evaluation of models, and a public\nleaderboard at https://github.com/slovak-nlp/sklep in the hopes of fostering\nreproducibility and drive future research in Slovak NLU."}

But what justifies making inferences about an LLM's capabilities\nbased on its answers to a curated set of questions? This paper first introduces\na formal framework to address this question. The key is to note that the\nbenchmarks used to test LLMs -- such as AP exams -- are also those used to test\npeople. However, this raises an implication: these benchmarks are only valid\ntests if LLMs misunderstand concepts in ways that mirror human\nmisunderstandings. Otherwise, success on benchmarks only demonstrates potemkin\nunderstanding: the illusion of understanding driven by answers irreconcilable\nwith how any human would interpret a concept. We present two procedures for\nquantifying the existence of potemkins: one using a specially designed\nbenchmark in three domains, the other using a general procedure that provides a\nlower-bound on their prevalence. We find that potemkins are ubiquitous across\nmodels, tasks, and domains. We also find that these failures reflect not just\nincorrect understanding, but deeper internal incoherence in concept\nrepresentations."}

We use\nHealthChat-11K and a clinician-driven taxonomy for how users interact with LLMs\nwhen seeking healthcare information in order to systematically study user\ninteractions across 21 distinct health specialties. Our analysis reveals\ninsights into the nature of how and why users seek health information, such as\ncommon interactions, instances of incomplete context, affective behaviors, and\ninteractions (e.g., leading questions) that can induce sycophancy, underscoring\nthe need for improvements in the healthcare support capabilities of LLMs\ndeployed as conversational AI.

Our WorldVLA intergrates\nVision-Language-Action (VLA) model and world model in one single framework. The\nworld model predicts future images by leveraging both action and image\nunderstanding, with the purpose of learning the underlying physics of the\nenvironment to improve action generation. Meanwhile, the action model generates\nthe subsequent actions based on image observations, aiding in visual\nunderstanding and in turn helps visual generation of the world model. We\ndemonstrate that WorldVLA outperforms standalone action and world models,\nhighlighting the mutual enhancement between the world model and the action\nmodel. In addition, we find that the performance of the action model\ndeteriorates when generating sequences of actions in an autoregressive manner.\nThis phenomenon can be attributed to the model's limited generalization\ncapability for action prediction, leading to the propagation of errors from\nearlier actions to subsequent ones. To address this issue, we propose an\nattention mask strategy that selectively masks prior actions during the\ngeneration of the current action, which shows significant performance\nimprovement in the action chunk generation task."}

However, these models often exhibit\nhallucinations by producing segmentation masks for objects not grounded in the\nimage content or by incorrectly labeling irrelevant regions.

In response, we introduce\nHalluSegBench, the first benchmark specifically designed to evaluate\nhallucinations in visual grounding through the lens of counterfactual visual\nreasoning. Our benchmark consists of a novel dataset of 1340 counterfactual\ninstance pairs spanning 281 unique object classes, and a set of newly\nintroduced metrics that quantify hallucination sensitivity under visually\ncoherent scene edits. Experiments on HalluSegBench with state-of-the-art\nvision-language segmentation models reveal that vision-driven hallucinations\nare significantly more prevalent than label-driven ones, with models often\npersisting in false segmentation, highlighting the need for counterfactual\nreasoning to diagnose grounding fidelity."}
