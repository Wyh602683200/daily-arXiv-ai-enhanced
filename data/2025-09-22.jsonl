Because a scheming AI would deliberately try to hide its\nmisaligned goals and actions, measuring and mitigating scheming requires\ndifferent strategies than are typically used in ML. We propose that assessing\nanti-scheming interventions requires at least (1) testing propensity to scheme\non far out-of-distribution (OOD) tasks, (2) evaluating whether lack of scheming\nis driven by situational awareness, and (3) checking for robustness to\npre-existing misaligned goals. We use a broad category of \"covert actions\" --\nsuch as secretly breaking rules or intentionally underperforming in tests -- as\na proxy for scheming, and design evaluations for covert actions. We then\nstress-test deliberative alignment as a case study for anti-scheming. Across 26\nOOD evaluations (180+ environments), deliberative alignment reduces covert\naction rates (OpenAI o3: 13%->0.4%) but does not fully eliminate them. Our\nmitigation is also able to largely stop agents from pursuing a hidden goal\npreviously trained into the model, but we still find misbehavior after\nadditional red-teaming. We find that models' chain-of-thought (CoT) often\ndemonstrates awareness of being evaluated for alignment, and show causal\nevidence that this awareness decreases covert behavior, while unawareness\nincreases it. Therefore, we cannot exclude that the observed reductions in\ncovert action rates are at least partially driven by situational awareness.\nWhile we rely on human-legible CoT for training, studying situational\nawareness, and demonstrating clear evidence of misalignment, our ability to\nrely on this degrades as models continue to depart from reasoning in standard\nEnglish.

Through careful theoretical derivations, we show that the evaluation\noutcome of an image under current SOD metrics can be essentially decomposed\ninto a sum of several separable terms, with the contribution of each term being\ndirectly proportional to its corresponding region size. Consequently, the\nprediction errors would be dominated by the larger regions, while smaller yet\npotentially more semantically important objects are often overlooked, leading\nto biased performance assessments and practical degradation. To address this\nchallenge, a generic Size-Invariant Evaluation (SIEva) framework is proposed.\nThe core idea is to evaluate each separable component individually and then\naggregate the results, thereby effectively mitigating the impact of size\nimbalance across objects.

We\ndemonstrate the promise of LZN in three increasingly complex scenarios: (1) LZN\ncan enhance existing models (image generation): When combined with the SoTA\nRectified Flow model, LZN improves FID on CIFAR10 from 2.76 to 2.59-without\nmodifying the training objective.

First, most existing\ndynamic GNN methods are built on temporally fixed static graphs, which fail to\nreflect the evolving nature of brain connectivity during seizure progression.\nSecond, current efforts to jointly model temporal signals and graph structures\nand, more importantly, their interactions remain nascent, often resulting in\ninconsistent performance. To address these challenges, we present the first\ntheoretical analysis of these two problems, demonstrating the effectiveness and\nnecessity of explicit dynamic modeling and time-then-graph dynamic GNN method.\nBuilding on these insights, we propose EvoBrain, a novel seizure detection\nmodel that integrates a two-stream Mamba architecture with a GCN enhanced by\nLaplacian Positional Encoding, following neurological insights. Moreover,\nEvoBrain incorporates explicitly dynamic graph structures, allowing both nodes\nand edges to evolve over time. Our contributions include (a) a theoretical\nanalysis proving the expressivity advantage of explicit dynamic modeling and\ntime-then-graph over other approaches, (b) a novel and efficient model that\nsignificantly improves AUROC by 23% and F1 score by 30%, compared with the\ndynamic GNN baseline, and (c) broad evaluations of our method on the\nchallenging early seizure prediction tasks."}

To address this, we introduce the Repository Planning Graph (RPG),\na persistent representation that unifies proposal- and implementation-level\nplanning by encoding capabilities, file structures, data flows, and functions\nin one graph. RPG replaces ambiguous natural language with an explicit\nblueprint, enabling long-horizon planning and scalable repository generation.\nBuilding on RPG, we develop ZeroRepo, a graph-driven framework for repository\ngeneration from scratch. It operates in three stages: proposal-level planning\nand implementation-level refinement to construct the graph, followed by\ngraph-guided code generation with test validation. To evaluate this setting, we\nconstruct RepoCraft, a benchmark of six real-world projects with 1,052 tasks.\nOn RepoCraft, ZeroRepo produces repositories averaging nearly 36K LOC, roughly\n3.9$\\times$ the strongest baseline (Claude Code) and about 64$\\times$ other\nbaselines. It attains 81.5% functional coverage and a 69.7% pass rate,\nexceeding Claude Code by 27.3 and 35.8 percentage points, respectively. Further\nanalysis shows that RPG models complex dependencies, enables progressively more\nsophisticated planning through near-linear scaling, and enhances LLM\nunderstanding of repositories, thereby accelerating agent localization."}
