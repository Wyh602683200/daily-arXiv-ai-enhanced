We propose a novel geometric framework that models an\nLLM's reasoning as flows -- embedding trajectories evolving where logic goes.\nWe disentangle logical structure from semantics by employing the same natural\ndeduction propositions with varied semantic carriers, allowing us to test\nwhether LLMs internalize logic beyond surface form. This perspective connects\nreasoning with geometric quantities such as position, velocity, and curvature,\nenabling formal analysis in representation and concept spaces. Our theory\nestablishes: (1) LLM reasoning corresponds to smooth flows in representation\nspace, and (2) logical statements act as local controllers of these flows'\nvelocities. Using learned representation proxies, we design controlled\nexperiments to visualize and quantify reasoning flows, providing empirical\nvalidation of our theoretical framework.

We reconceptualize this challenge as a distributional problem. We\npropose a new paradigm where the optimization goal is not to maximize a scalar\nscore, but to directly minimize a workflow's Expected Failure Mass, i.e., the\nintegral of its failure probability density function defined over a\nhigh-dimensional Failure Signature Space (FSS).

UCAS operates in two stages: it first modulates\nthe response-level advantage using the model's overall self-confidence, and\nthen applies a token-level penalty based on raw logit certainty. This dual\nmechanism encourages exploration of high-uncertainty paths that yield correct\nanswers while penalizing overconfident yet erroneous reasoning, effectively\nbalancing the exploration-exploitation trade-off. Extensive experiments on five\nmathematical reasoning benchmarks show that UCAS significantly outperforms\nstrong RLVR baselines across multiple model scales, including 1.5B and 7B. Our\nanalysis confirms that UCAS not only achieves higher rewards but also promotes\ngreater reasoning diversity and successfully mitigates entropy collapse."}

ARIA integrates six interoperable layers, namely Command, Context,\nCode, Data, Orchestration, and AI Module, within a document-centric workflow\nthat unifies human reasoning and machine execution. Through natural-language\nspecifications, researchers define analytical goals while ARIA autonomously\ngenerates executable code, validates computations, and produces transparent\ndocumentation. Beyond achieving high predictive accuracy, ARIA can rapidly\nidentify optimal feature sets and select suitable models, minimizing redundant\ntuning and repetitive experimentation. In the Boston Housing case, ARIA\ndiscovered 25 key features and determined XGBoost as the best performing model\n(R square = 0.93) with minimal overfitting. Evaluations across heterogeneous\ndomains demonstrate ARIA's strong performance, interpretability, and efficiency\ncompared with state-of-the-art systems. By combining AI for research and AI for\nscience principles within a spec-driven architecture, ARIA establishes a new\nparadigm for transparent, collaborative, and reproducible scientific discovery."}

This\ncognitive gap leads to responses that are superficial, brittle and\nshort-sighted. To address this, we propose Critique-Driven Reasoning Alignment\n(CDRA), which reframes alignment from a scalar reward-matching task into a\nstructured reasoning process. First, to bridge the preference inference gap, we\nintroduce the DeepPref benchmark. This dataset, comprising 3000\npreference-query pairs across 20 topics, is curated by simulating a\nmulti-faceted cognitive council that produces critique-annotated reasoning\nchains to deconstruct query semantics and reveal latent risks. Second, to\ninstill defensive reasoning, we introduce the Personalized Generative Process\nReward Model (Pers-GenPRM), which frames reward modeling as a personalized\nreasoning task. It generates a critique chain to evaluate a response's\nalignment with user preferences before outputting a final score based on this\nrationale. Ultimately, this interpretable, structured reward signal guides\npolicy model through Critique-Driven Policy Alignment, a process-level online\nreinforcement learning algorithm integrating both numerical and natural\nlanguage feedback.

Unlike prior work that relies on manual graph construction or\nunstructured reasoning, PADME autonomously transforms procedural text into\nexecutable graphs that capture task dependencies, decision points, and reusable\nsubroutines.

This separation ensures\nquality assurance and scalability, allowing expert knowledge to be encoded once\nand reliably reused across varying contexts.

To address these limitations, we propose a\nnovel framework called \\emph{coupled data and measurement space diffusion\nposterior sampling} (C-DPS), which eliminates the need for constraint tuning or\nlikelihood approximation. C-DPS introduces a forward stochastic process in the\nmeasurement space $\\{\\boldsymbol{y}_t\\}$, evolving in parallel with the\ndata-space diffusion $\\{\\boldsymbol{x}_t\\}$, which enables the derivation of a\nclosed-form posterior $p(\\boldsymbol{x}_{t-1} \\mid \\boldsymbol{x}_t,\n\\boldsymbol{y}_{t-1})$. This coupling allows for accurate and recursive\nsampling based on a well-defined posterior distribution. Empirical results\ndemonstrate that C-DPS consistently outperforms existing baselines, both\nqualitatively and quantitatively, across multiple inverse problem benchmarks."}

Integrating long-term\nmemory mechanisms allows agents to make informed decisions grounded in\nhistorical interactions. While recent advances have significantly improved the\nstorage and retrieval components, by encoding memory into dense vectors for\nsimilarity search or organizing memory as structured knowledge graphs most\nexisting approaches fall short in memory updating. In particular, they lack\nmechanisms for dynamically refining preference memory representations in\nresponse to evolving user behaviors and contexts. To address this gap, we\npropose a Preference-Aware Memory Update Mechanism (PAMU) that enables dynamic\nand personalized memory refinement. By integrating sliding window averages (SW)\nwith exponential moving averages (EMA), PAMU constructs a fused\npreference-aware representation that captures both short-term fluctuations and\nlong-term user tendencies. We conduct experiments on five task scenarios of the\nLoCoMo dataset, and the results show that our mechanism can significantly\nimprove the output quality of LLM in five baselines, validating its\neffectiveness in long-term conversations."}

However,\nexisting methods, including constraint-based (e.g., PC, causalMGM) and\nscore-based approaches (e.g., NOTEARS), face significant limitations. These\ninclude an inability to resolve causal direction, restrictions to linear\nassociations, sensitivity to violations of the faithfulness assumption, and\ninefficiency in searching vast hypothesis spaces. While large language models\n(LLMs) offer powerful reasoning capabilities, their application is hindered by\na fundamental discrepancy: they are designed for text, while most causal data\nis tabular. To address these challenges, we introduce CALM, a novel causal\nanalysis language model specifically designed for tabular data in complex\nsystems. CALM leverages a Mamba-based architecture to classify causal patterns\nfrom pairwise variable relationships. It integrates a comprehensive suite of\nevidence, including local causal scores, conditional independence tests, and\nrelational attributes, to capture a wide spectrum of linear, nonlinear, and\nconditional causal mechanisms. Trained on a diverse corpus of synthetic data\n(from linear, mixed, and nonlinear models) and 10 real-world biological\ndatasets with rigorously validated causal relationships, our model ensures\nrobustness and generalizability.

On three diverse datasets, we fine-tune arLLMs and dLLMs,\nevaluating them with forward and backward style Question Answering (QA) to\nprobe knowledge generalization and the reversal curse. Our results confirm that\narLLMs critically rely on extensive data augmentation via paraphrases for QA\ngeneralization, and paraphrases are only effective when their information order\nmatches the QA style.

We begin by presenting the foundational theoretical concepts of\nCVCNNs, including complex convolutions, pooling layers, Wirtinger-based\ndifferentiation, and various complex-valued activation functions. These are\ncomplemented by critical adaptations of training techniques, including complex\nbatch normalization and weight initialization schemes, to ensure stability in\ntraining dynamics. Empirical evaluations are conducted across three stages.\nFirst, CVCNNs are benchmarked on standard image datasets, where they\ndemonstrate competitive performance with real-valued CNNs, even under synthetic\ncomplex perturbations. Although our focus is audio signal processing, we first\nevaluate CVCNNs on image datasets to establish baseline performance and\nvalidate training stability before applying them to audio tasks. In the second\nexperiment, we focus on audio classification using Mel-Frequency Cepstral\nCoefficients (MFCCs). CVCNNs trained on real-valued MFCCs slightly outperform\nreal CNNs, while preserving phase in input workflows highlights challenges in\nexploiting phase without architectural modifications. Finally, a third\nexperiment introduces GNNs to model phase information via edge weighting, where\nthe inclusion of phase yields measurable gains in both binary and multi-class\ngenre classification.

The method first uses a large language model to\nobtain contextual embeddings of text and then introduces a temporal decay\nfunction and an attention mechanism. These components allow the model to adjust\nthe importance of semantic units according to time intervals and capture topic\nvariations across different periods. The temporal representations are then\nmapped into a latent topic space, where a state transition matrix is applied to\ndescribe the dynamic evolution of topics. A joint optimization objective\nconstrains both semantic modeling and temporal consistency, ensuring diversity\nand smoothness in topic generation. The design emphasizes the unified modeling\nof semantic representation and temporal evolution, which improves topic\ncoherence and diversity while enhancing stability and interpretability over\ntime. Experiments on real-world corpora show that the framework effectively\ncaptures the generation, expansion, and decline of topics and outperforms\nexisting models across multiple metrics.

This allows commands such as 'Please decrease\nthe temperature by 20 % in machine 1 and set the motor speed to 5000 rpm in\nmachine 2.' The large language model receives the user input and selects one of\nthree predefined tools that connect to an OPC UA server and either change or\nread the value of a node.

However, this augmentation effect is\nlimited since ControlNets tend to reproduce the original training distribution.\n  This work introduces a method to utilize data from unlabeled domains to train\nControlNets by introducing the concept of uncertainty into the control\nmechanism. The uncertainty indicates that a given image was not part of the\ntraining distribution of a downstream task, e.g., segmentation. Thus, two types\nof control are engaged in the final network: an uncertainty control from an\nunlabeled dataset and a semantic control from the labeled dataset. The\nresulting ControlNet allows us to create annotated data with high uncertainty\nfrom the target domain, i.e., synthetic data from the unlabeled distribution\nwith labels. In our scenario, we consider retinal OCTs, where typically\nhigh-quality Spectralis images are available with given ground truth\nsegmentations, enabling the training of segmentation networks. The recent\ndevelopment in Home-OCT devices, however, yields retinal OCTs with lower\nquality and a large domain shift, such that out-of-the-pocket segmentation\nnetworks cannot be applied for this type of data.

While traditional retrieval focuses on\nrelevance, RAG's effectiveness depends on the utility of retrieved passages,\ni.e., the usefulness in facilitating the generation of an accurate and\ncomprehensive answer. Existing studies often treat utility as a generic\nattribute, ignoring the fact that different LLMs may benefit differently from\nthe same passage due to variations in internal knowledge and comprehension\nability. In this work, we introduce and systematically investigate the notion\nof LLM-specific utility. Through large-scale experiments across multiple\ndatasets and LLMs, we demonstrate that human-annotated passages are not optimal\nfor LLMs and that ground-truth utilitarian passages are not transferable across\ndifferent LLMs. These findings highlight the necessity of adopting the\nLLM-specific utility in RAG research. Our findings indicate that some\nhuman-annotated passages are not ground-truth utilitarian passages for specific\nLLMs, partially due to the varying readability of queries and passages for\nLLMs, a tendency for which perplexity is a key metric. Based on these findings,\nwe propose a benchmarking procedure for LLM-specific utility judgments. We\nevaluate existing utility judgment methods on six datasets and find that while\nverbalized methods using pseudo-answers perform robustly, LLMs struggle to\nassess utility effectively-failing to reject all passages for known queries and\nto select truly useful ones for unknown queries."}

After introducing the\nDelay-Constrained Maximum-Throughput (DCMT) dynamic network control problem,\nand highlighting the limitations of current solutions, we present a novel\nMA-DRL network control framework that leverages a centralized routing and\ndistributed scheduling architecture. The proposed framework leverages critical\nnetworking domain knowledge for the design of effective MA-DRL strategies based\non the Multi-Agent Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient (MADDPG) technique, where\ncentralized routing and distributed scheduling agents dynamically assign paths\nand schedule packet transmissions according to packet lifetimes, thereby\nmaximizing on-time packet delivery. The generality of the proposed framework\nallows integrating both data-driven \\blue{Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL)}\nagents and traditional rule-based policies in order to strike the right balance\nbetween performance and learning complexity. Our results confirm the\nsuperiority of the proposed framework with respect to traditional stochastic\noptimization-based approaches and provide key insights into the role and\ninterplay between data-driven DRL agents and new rule-based policies for both\nefficient and high-performance control of latency-critical services."}

While reinforcement learning (RL) policies\ntrained in simulation present a scalable alternative, effective sim-to-real\ntransfer remains challenging, particularly for tasks that require precise\ndynamics. To address this, we propose Phys2Real, a real-to-sim-to-real RL\npipeline that combines vision-language model (VLM)-inferred physical parameter\nestimates with interactive adaptation through uncertainty-aware fusion. Our\napproach consists of three core components: (1) high-fidelity geometric\nreconstruction with 3D Gaussian splatting, (2) VLM-inferred prior distributions\nover physical parameters, and (3) online physical parameter estimation from\ninteraction data. Phys2Real conditions policies on interpretable physical\nparameters, refining VLM predictions with online estimates via ensemble-based\nuncertainty quantification. On planar pushing tasks of a T-block with varying\ncenter of mass (CoM) and a hammer with an off-center mass distribution,\nPhys2Real achieves substantial improvements over a domain randomization\nbaseline: 100% vs 79% success rate for the bottom-weighted T-block, 57% vs 23%\nin the challenging top-weighted T-block, and 15% faster average task completion\nfor hammer pushing. Ablation studies indicate that the combination of VLM and\ninteraction information is essential for success. Project website:\nhttps://phys2real.github.io/ ."}

This work argues that a crucial advantage of MLLM-based\napproaches stems from implicit cross-modal alignment achieved during generative\npretraining, where the language decoder learns to exploit multimodal signals\nwithin a shared representation space for generating unimodal outputs. Through\nanalysis of anisotropy and kernel similarity structure, we empirically confirm\nthat latent alignment emerges within MLLM representations, allowing CL to serve\nas a lightweight refinement stage. Leveraging this insight, we propose a\nLanguage-Centric Omnimodal Embedding framework, termed LCO-Emb. Extensive\nexperiments across diverse backbones and benchmarks demonstrate its\neffectiveness, achieving state-of-the-art performance across modalities.\nFurthermore, we identify a Generation-Representation Scaling Law (GRSL),\nshowing that the representational capabilities gained through contrastive\nrefinement scales positively with the MLLM's generative capabilities. This\nsuggests that improving generative abilities evolves as an effective paradigm\nfor enhancing representation quality. We provide a theoretical explanation of\nGRSL, which formally links the MLLM's generative quality to the upper bound on\nits representation performance, and validate it on a challenging, low-resource\nvisual-document retrieval task, showing that continual generative pretraining\nbefore CL can further enhance the potential of a model's embedding\ncapabilities.

In this paper, we instead argue that adversarial\nvulnerability can stem from efficient information encoding in neural networks.\nSpecifically, we show how superposition - where networks represent more\nfeatures than they have dimensions - creates arrangements of latent\nrepresentations that adversaries can exploit. We demonstrate that adversarial\nperturbations leverage interference between superposed features, making attack\npatterns predictable from feature arrangements. Our framework provides a\nmechanistic explanation for two known phenomena: adversarial attack\ntransferability between models with similar training regimes and class-specific\nvulnerability patterns. In synthetic settings with precisely controlled\nsuperposition, we establish that superposition suffices to create adversarial\nvulnerability. We then demonstrate that these findings persist in a ViT trained\non CIFAR-10. These findings reveal adversarial vulnerability can be a byproduct\nof networks' representational compression, rather than flaws in the learning\nprocess or non-robust inputs."}

To address this, we\npropose CodePlot-CoT, a code-driven Chain-of-Thought paradigm for \"thinking\nwith images\" in mathematics. Our approach leverages the VLM to generate text\nreasoning as well as executable plotting code, which is then rendered into\nimages as \"visual thought\", to solve mathematical problems. To achieve this, we\nfirst construct Math-VR, the first large-scale, bilingual dataset and benchmark\nfor Mathematics problems with Visual Reasoning, comprising 178K samples.\nSecond, to create high-quality training data, we develop a state-of-the-art\nimage-to-code converter specialized for parsing complex mathematical figures\ninto codes. Finally, using these training data, we train the CodePlot-CoT model\nfor solving mathematical problems. Experimental results show that our model\nachieves up to 21% increase over base model on our new benchmark, fully\nvalidating the efficacy of our proposed code-driven reasoning paradigm.
