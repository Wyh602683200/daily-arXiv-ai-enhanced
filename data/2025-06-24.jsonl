In order to solve this problem, this\npaper proposes an intelligent log processing and automatic debugging framework\nbased on Large Language Model (LLM), named Intelligent Debugger (LLM-ID). This\nmethod is extended on the basis of the existing pre-trained Transformer model,\nand integrates a multi-stage semantic inference mechanism to realize the\ncontext understanding of system logs and the automatic reconstruction of fault\nchains. Firstly, the system log is dynamically structured, and the unsupervised\nclustering and embedding mechanism is used to extract the event template and\nsemantic schema. Subsequently, the fine-tuned LLM combined with the multi-round\nattention mechanism to perform contextual reasoning on the log sequence to\ngenerate potential fault assumptions and root cause paths. Furthermore, this\npaper introduces a reinforcement learning-based policy-guided recovery planner,\nwhich is driven by the remediation strategy generated by LLM to support dynamic\ndecision-making and adaptive debugging in the cloud environment. Compared with\nthe existing rule engine or traditional log analysis system, the proposed model\nhas stronger semantic understanding ability, continuous learning ability and\nheterogeneous environment adaptability. Experiments on the cloud platform log\ndataset show that LLM-ID improves the fault location accuracy by 16.2%, which\nis significantly better than the current mainstream methods"}

Nevertheless, existing agent systems encounter notable\nlimitations. Firstly, they predominantly depend on trial and error decision\nmaking rather than progressive reasoning, thereby lacking the capability to\nlearn and adapt from interactive encounters. Secondly, these systems are\nassessed using overly simplistic single step accuracy metrics, which do not\nadequately reflect the intricate nature of real world GUI interactions. In this\npaper, we present CogniGUI, a cognitive framework developed to overcome these\nlimitations by enabling adaptive learning for GUI automation resembling\nhuman-like behavior. Inspired by Kahneman's Dual Process Theory, our approach\ncombines two main components: (1) an omni parser engine that conducts immediate\nhierarchical parsing of GUI elements through quick visual semantic analysis to\nidentify actionable components, and (2) a Group based Relative Policy\nOptimization (GRPO) grounding agent that assesses multiple interaction paths\nusing a unique relative reward system, promoting minimal and efficient\noperational routes. This dual-system design facilitates iterative ''exploration\nlearning mastery'' cycles, enabling the agent to enhance its strategies over\ntime based on accumulated experience. Moreover, to assess the generalization\nand adaptability of agent systems, we introduce ScreenSeek, a comprehensive\nbenchmark that includes multi application navigation, dynamic state\ntransitions, and cross interface coherence, which are often overlooked\nchallenges in current benchmarks. Experimental results demonstrate that\nCogniGUI surpasses state-of-the-art methods in both the current GUI grounding\nbenchmarks and our newly proposed benchmark."}

Despite this\ncommon practice, it remains unknown whether edits persist after fine-tuning or\nwhether they are inadvertently reversed. This question has fundamental\npractical implications. For example, if fine-tuning removes prior edits, it\ncould serve as a defence mechanism against hidden malicious edits. Vice versa,\nthe unintended removal of edits related to bias mitigation could pose serious\nsafety concerns. We systematically investigate the interaction between model\nediting and fine-tuning in the context of T2I diffusion models, which are known\nto exhibit biases and generate inappropriate content. Our study spans two T2I\nmodel families (Stable Diffusion and FLUX), two sota editing techniques, and\nthree fine-tuning methods (DreamBooth, LoRA, and DoRA). Through an extensive\nempirical analysis across diverse editing tasks and evaluation metrics, our\nfindings reveal a trend: edits generally fail to persist through fine-tuning,\neven when fine-tuning is tangential or unrelated to the edits. Notably, we\nobserve that DoRA exhibits the strongest edit reversal effect. At the same\ntime, among editing methods, UCE demonstrates greater robustness, retaining\nsignificantly higher efficacy post-fine-tuning compared to ReFACT. These\nfindings highlight a crucial limitation in current editing methodologies,\nemphasizing the need for more robust techniques to ensure reliable long-term\ncontrol and alignment of deployed AI systems. These findings have dual\nimplications for AI safety: they suggest that fine-tuning could serve as a\nremediation mechanism for malicious edits while simultaneously highlighting the\nneed for re-editing after fine-tuning to maintain beneficial safety and\nalignment properties."}

To explore this idea, we finetune LLMs on two sets of\nprograms representing simple maths problems and algorithms: one with source\ncode and I/O examples (w/ IO), the other with source code only (w/o IO). We\nfind evidence that LLMs have some ability to evaluate w/o IO programs for\ninputs in a range of experimental settings, and make several observations.\nFirstly, PBB works significantly better when programs are provided as code\nrather than semantically equivalent language descriptions. Secondly, LLMs can\nproduce outputs for w/o IO programs directly, by implicitly evaluating the\nprogram within the forward pass, and more reliably when stepping through the\nprogram in-context via chain-of-thought. We further show that PBB leads to more\nrobust evaluation of programs across inputs than training on I/O pairs drawn\nfrom a distribution that mirrors naturally occurring data.

The\nproposed framework leverages the reasoning capabilities of LLMs during the\nretrieval process, while seamlessly integrating GNNs to enhance overall\nrecommendation performance. Extensive experiments on various datasets and\nsettings demonstrate that our proposed CORONA achieves state-of-the-art\nperformance with an 18.6% relative improvement in recall and an 18.4% relative\nimprovement in NDCG on average."}

This study systematically evaluates\ncommon and medical VLMs across disease diagnosis and visual question answering\n(VQA). Using CLIP-based and LLaVA-based models, we examine (1) off-the-shelf\nperformance gaps in in-domain (ID) settings, (2) whether fine-tuning bridges\nthese gaps, and (3) generalization to out-of-domain (OOD) tasks on unseen\nmedical modalities.

This paper\nintroduces the Co-Forgetting Protocol, a novel, comprehensive framework\ndesigned to address this challenge by enabling synchronized memory pruning in\nMAS. The protocol integrates three key components: (1) context-aware semantic\nvoting, where agents utilize a lightweight DistilBERT model to assess the\nrelevance of memory items based on their content and the current operational\ncontext; (2) multi-scale temporal decay functions, which assign diminishing\nimportance to memories based on their age and access frequency across different\ntime horizons; and (3) a Practical Byzantine Fault Tolerance (PBFT)-based\nconsensus mechanism, ensuring that decisions to retain or discard memory items\nare agreed upon by a qualified and fault-tolerant majority of agents, even in\nthe presence of up to f Byzantine (malicious or faulty) agents in a system of N\ngreater than or equal to 3f+1 agents. The protocol leverages gRPC for efficient\ninter-agent communication and Pinecone for scalable vector embedding storage\nand similarity search, with SQLite managing metadata. Experimental evaluations\nin a simulated MAS environment with four agents demonstrate the protocol's\nefficacy, achieving a 52% reduction in memory footprint over 500 epochs, 88%\nvoting accuracy in forgetting decisions against human-annotated benchmarks, a\n92% PBFT consensus success rate under simulated Byzantine conditions, and an\n82% cache hit rate for memory access."}

However, prior work has focused on\nsolely the text portion of the bias rather than both the text and image\nportions. This is a problem because the images are just as powerful of a medium\nto communicate information as text is. To that end, we present a model that\nleverages both text and image bias which consists of four different steps.\nImage Text Alignment focuses on semantically aligning images based on their\nbias through CLIP models. Image Bias Scoring determines the appropriate bias\nscore of images via a ViT classifier. Text De-Biasing focuses on detecting\nbiased words and phrases and neutralizing them through BERT models. These three\nsteps all culminate to the final step of debiasing, which replaces the text and\nthe image with neutralized or reduced counterparts, which for images is done by\ncomparing the bias scores. The results so far indicate that this approach is\npromising, with the text debiasing strategy being able to identify many\npotential biased words and phrases, and the ViT model showcasing effective\ntraining. The semantic alignment model also is efficient. However, more time,\nparticularly in training, and resources are needed to obtain better results.

Specifically, we start with the observation that\nwhen trained to learn a mixture of tasks, as is popular in the literature, the\nstrategies learned by a model for performing ICL can be captured by a family of\nBayesian predictors: a memorizing predictor, which assumes a discrete prior on\nthe set of seen tasks, and a generalizing predictor, wherein the prior matches\nthe underlying task distribution. Adopting the lens of rational analysis from\ncognitive science, where a learner's behavior is explained as an optimal\nadaptation to data given computational constraints, we develop a hierarchical\nBayesian framework that almost perfectly predicts Transformer next token\npredictions throughout training without assuming access to its weights. Under\nthis framework, pretraining is viewed as a process of updating the posterior\nprobability of different strategies, and its inference-time behavior as a\nposterior-weighted average over these strategies' predictions. Our framework\ndraws on common assumptions about neural network learning dynamics, which make\nexplicit a tradeoff between loss and complexity among candidate strategies:\nbeyond how well it explains the data, a model's preference towards implementing\na strategy is dictated by its complexity. This helps explain well-known ICL\nphenomena, while offering novel predictions: e.g., we show a superlinear trend\nin the timescale for transition to memorization as task diversity is increased.\nOverall, our work advances an explanatory and predictive account of ICL\ngrounded in tradeoffs between strategy loss and complexity."}

What drives this stability in the\ngeneration? We investigate this phenomenon through the lens of probability\nconcentration in the model's output distribution. To quantify this\nconcentration, we introduce the Branching Factor (BF) -- a token-invariant\nmeasure of the effective number of plausible next steps during generation. Our\nempirical analysis reveals two key findings: (1) BF often decreases as\ngeneration progresses, suggesting that LLMs become more predictable as they\ngenerate. (2) alignment tuning substantially sharpens the model's output\ndistribution from the outset, reducing BF by nearly an order of magnitude\n(e.g., from 12 to 1.2) relative to base models. This stark reduction helps\nexplain why aligned models often appear less sensitive to decoding strategies.\nBuilding on this insight, we find this stability has surprising implications\nfor complex reasoning. Aligned Chain-of-Thought (CoT) models (e.g.,\nDeepSeek-distilled models), for instance, leverage this effect; by generating\nlonger reasoning chains, they push generation into later, more deterministic\n(lower BF) stages, resulting in more stable outputs. We hypothesize that\nalignment tuning does not fundamentally change a model's behavior, but instead\nsteers it toward stylistic tokens (e.g., \"Sure\") that unlock low-entropy\ntrajectories already present in the base model. This view is supported by\nnudging experiments, which show that prompting base models with such tokens can\nsimilarly reduce BF. Together, our findings establish BF as a powerful\ndiagnostic for understanding and controlling LLM outputs - clarifying how\nalignment reduces variability, how CoT promotes stable generations, and how\nbase models can be steered away from diversity."}

SIM-Net is particularly well-suited for\nthe classification of digitized herbarium specimens (a task made challenging by\nheterogeneous backgrounds), non-plant elements, and occlusions that compromise\nconventional image-based models.

As the field grows in influence,\nit is increasingly important to examine not just models themselves, but the\nassumptions, concepts and explanatory strategies implicit in MI research.

Our\n  dataset can be found at https://huggingface.co/datasets/IceInPot/TAMMs", "summary": "Satellite image time-series analysis demands fine-grained spatial-temporal\nreasoning, which remains a challenge for existing multimodal large language\nmodels (MLLMs). In this work, we study the capabilities of MLLMs on a novel\ntask that jointly targets temporal change understanding and future scene\ngeneration, aiming to assess their potential for modeling complex multimodal\ndynamics over time. We propose TAMMs, a Temporal-Aware Multimodal Model for\nsatellite image change understanding and forecasting, which enhances frozen\nMLLMs with lightweight temporal modules for structured sequence encoding and\ncontextual prompting. To guide future image generation, TAMMs introduces a\nSemantic-Fused Control Injection (SFCI) mechanism that adaptively combines\nhigh-level semantic reasoning and structural priors within an enhanced\nControlNet. This dual-path conditioning enables temporally consistent and\nsemantically grounded image synthesis. Experiments demonstrate that TAMMs\noutperforms strong MLLM baselines in both temporal change understanding and\nfuture image forecasting tasks, highlighting how carefully designed temporal\nreasoning and semantic fusion can unlock the full potential of MLLMs for\nspatio-temporal understanding."}

This\ndesign enables OmniGen2 to build upon existing multimodal understanding models\nwithout the need to re-adapt VAE inputs, thereby preserving the original text\ngeneration capabilities. To facilitate the training of OmniGen2, we developed\ncomprehensive data construction pipelines, encompassing image editing and\nin-context generation data.

To address this, we propose Commutative\nVector Quantization (CommVQ) to significantly reduce memory usage for\nlong-context LLM inference. We first introduce additive quantization with a\nlightweight encoder and codebook to compress the KV cache, which can be decoded\nvia simple matrix multiplication. To further reduce computational costs during\ndecoding, we design the codebook to be commutative with Rotary Position\nEmbedding (RoPE) and train it using an Expectation-Maximization (EM) algorithm.\nThis enables efficient integration of decoding into the self-attention\nmechanism. Our approach achieves high accuracy with additive quantization and\nlow overhead via the RoPE-commutative codebook. Experiments on long-context\nbenchmarks and GSM8K show that our method reduces FP16 KV cache size by 87.5%\nwith 2-bit quantization, while outperforming state-of-the-art KV cache\nquantization methods. Notably, it enables 1-bit KV cache quantization with\nminimal accuracy loss, allowing a LLaMA-3.1 8B model to run with a 128K context\nlength on a single RTX 4090 GPU.

To address these challenges, we propose\nManipulate in Dream (MinD), a hierarchical diffusion-based world model\nframework that employs a dual-system design for vision-language manipulation.\nMinD executes VGM at low frequencies to extract video prediction features,\nwhile leveraging a high-frequency diffusion policy for real-time interaction.\nThis architecture enables low-latency, closed-loop control in manipulation with\ncoherent visual guidance. To better coordinate the two systems, we introduce a\nvideo-action diffusion matching module (DiffMatcher), with a novel co-training\nstrategy that uses separate schedulers for each diffusion model.
